However, even an experienced surgeon despite using advanced techniques may not be able to fully prevent the formation of adhesions following surgery, without the aid of an adhesion barrier. Consequently, many surgeons apply adhesion barriers while performing abdominal and pelvic surgery. However, one study found the frequency of adhesion barrier use to be very low.

Dahl knew Wade to be an expert in precision hydraulic engineering, from their shared hobby of flying model aircraft. (In addition to building his own model aircraft engines, Wade ran a factory at High Wycombe for producing precision hydraulic pumps.) With Dahl coordinating the efforts of the neurosurgeon and the hydraulic engineer, the team developed a new mechanism using two metal discs, each in a restrictive housing at the end of a short silicone rubber tube. Fluid moving under pressure from below pushed the discs against the tube to prevent retrograde flow; pressure from above moved each disc to the ""open"" position. As Till reported in The Lancet, the invention was characterized by “low resistance, ease of sterilisation, no reflux, robust construction, and negligible risk of blockage”. By the time the device was perfected, Theo had healed to the point at which it was no longer necessary to implant the shunt in his skull. However, several thousand other children around the world benefited from the WDT valve before medicine technology progressed beyond it.

Medically, it occurs mostly in context of the complications from breast implants and artificial joint prosthetics. The occurrence of capsular contraction follows the formation of capsules of tightly-woven collagen fibers, created by the immune response to the presence of foreign objects surgically installed to the human body, e.g. breast implants, artificial pacemakers, orthopedic prostheses; biological protection by isolation and toleration. Capsular contracture occurs when the collagen-fiber capsule shrinks, tightens and compresses the breast implant, much like the collapse of a bubble gum bubble. It is a medical complication that can be painful and discomforting, and might distort the aesthetics of the breast implant and the breast. Although the cause of capsular contracture is unknown, factors common to its incidence include bacterial contamination, rupture of the breast-implant shell, leakage of the silicone-gel filling, and hematoma. Moreover, because capsular contracture is a consequence of the immune system defending the patient's bodily integrity and health, it might reoccur, even after the requisite corrective surgery for the initial incidence. The degree of an incidence of capsular contracture is graded using the four-grade Baker scale: 
* Grade I — the breast is normally soft and appears natural in size and shape 
* Grade II — the breast is a little firm, but appears normal 
* Grade III — the breast is firm and appears abnormal 
* Grade IV — the breast is hard, painful to the touch, and appears abnormal The surgical implantation methods that have reduced capsular contracture include submuscular breast implant placement, using either textured or polyurethane-coated implants, limited handling of the implants, minimal contact with the chest wall skin before their insertions, and irrigating the surgical sites with triple-antibiotic solutions. The use of textured implants may increase the risk of cancer. The correction of capsular contracture might require the surgical removal (release) of the capsule, or the removal, and possible replacement, of the breast implant, itself. Closed capsulotomy (disrupting the capsule via external manipulation), a once-common maneuver for treating hard capsules, was discontinued because it might rupture the breast implant. Non-surgical methods of treating capsules include massage, external ultrasound, treatment with leukotriene pathway inhibitors (e.g. Accolate, Singulair), and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy. The Mentor Worldwide LLC corporation, one of the three, U.S. FDA-approved breast-implant device manufacturers, conducted a study of the medical complications suffered by breast implantation surgery patients. In March 2000, at a Food and Drug Administration presentation, the Mentor report indicated that 43 per cent of patients with saline breast implants reported medical complications occurring within three years of the surgery; moreover, 10 per cent of that percentage group complained of capsular contracture.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Corrective103111899|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Implant103563710|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Prosthesis104013729|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatImplants

They are sometimes contrasted with a brain–computer interface, which connects the brain to a computer rather than a device meant to replace missing biological functionality. Neural prostheses are a series of devices that can substitute a motor, sensory or cognitive modality that might have been damaged as a result of an injury or a disease. Cochlear implants provide an example of such devices. These devices substitute the functions performed by the eardrum and stapes while simulating the frequency analysis performed in the cochlea. A microphone on an external unit gathers the sound and processes it; the processed signal is then transferred to an implanted unit that stimulates the auditory nerve through a microelectrode array. Through the replacement or augmentation of damaged senses, these devices intend to improve the quality of life for those with disabilities. These implantable devices are also commonly used in animal experimentation as a tool to aid neuroscientists in developing a greater understanding of the brain and its functioning. By wirelessly monitoring the brain's electrical signals sent out by electrodes implanted in the subject's brain, the subject can be studied without the device affecting the results. Accurately probing and recording the electrical signals in the brain would help better understand the relationship among a local population of neurons that are responsible for a specific function. Neural implants are designed to be as small as possible in order to be minimally invasive, particularly in areas surrounding the brain, eyes or cochlea. These implants typically communicate with their prosthetic counterparts wirelessly. Additionally, power is currently received through wireless power transmission through the skin. The tissue surrounding the implant is usually highly sensitive to temperature rise, meaning that power consumption must be minimal in order to prevent tissue damage. The neuroprosthetic currently undergoing the most widespread use is the cochlear implant, with over 300,000 in use worldwide as of 2012.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine)|http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroprosthetics,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Application100949134|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Occupation100582388|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Profession100609953|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Technology100949619|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Use100947128|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatEmergingTechnologies|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

Softgels are produced in a process known as encapsulation using the Rotary Die Encapsulation process invented by Robert Pauli Scherer. The encapsulation process has been described as a form/fill/seal process. Two flat ribbons of shell material are manufactured on the machine and brought together on a twin set of rotating dies. The dies contain recesses in the desired size and shape, which cut out the ribbons into a two-dimensional shape, and form a seal around the outside. At the same time a pump delivers a precise dose of fill material through a nozzle incorporated into a filling wedge whose tip sits between the two ribbons in between two die pockets at the point of cut out. The wedge is heated to facilitate the sealing process. The wedge injection causes the two flat ribbons to expand into the die pockets, giving rise to the three-dimensional finished product. After encapsulation, the softgels are dried for two days to two weeks depending on the product.

DPIs are an alternative to the aerosol-based inhalers commonly called metered-dose inhaler (or MDI). The DPIs may require some procedure to allow a measured dose of powder to be ready for the patient to take. The medication is commonly held either in a capsule for manual loading or a proprietary from inside the inhaler. Once loaded or actuated, the operator puts the mouthpiece of the inhaler into their mouth and takes a sharp, deep inhalation (ensuring that the medication reaches the lower parts of the lungs), holding their breath for 5–10 seconds. There are a variety of such devices. The dose that can be delivered is typically less than a few tens of milligrams in a single breath since larger powder doses may lead to provocation of cough. Most DPIs rely on the force of patient inhalation to entrain powder from the device and subsequently break-up the powder into particles that are small enough to reach the lungs. For this reason, insufficient patient inhalation flow rates may lead to reduced dose delivery and incomplete deaggregation of the powder, leading to unsatisfactory device performance.

Computers and motors inside of the device keep the Robstep upright when powered on with balancing enabled. A user commands the Robstep to go forward by shifting their weight forward on the platform, and backward by shifting their weight backward. The Robstep detects, as it balances, the change in its center of mass, and first establishes and then maintains a corresponding speed, forward or backward. Gyroscopic sensors and fluid-based level sensors detect the weight shift. To turn, the user presses the handlebar to the left or the right.Robsteps are driven by electric motors and can reach a speed of 9.3 miles per hour (15 km/h). Robsteps are comparable to Segways.

There has been some research into other types of silk, which differ at the molecular level. Silk is mainly produced by the larvae of insects undergoing complete metamorphosis, but some insects, such as webspinners and raspy crickets, produce silk throughout their lives. Silk production also occurs in hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants), silverfish, mayflies, thrips, leafhoppers, beetles, lacewings, fleas, flies, and midges.

Common bypass sites include the heart (coronary artery bypass surgery) to treat coronary artery disease, and the legs, where lower extremity bypass surgery is used to treat peripheral vascular disease.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

With respect to some infections like influenza they appear as effective as respirators, such as N95 or FFP masks; though the latter provide better protection in laboratory experiments due to their material, shape and tight seal. Surgical masks vary by quality and levels of protection. Despite their name, not all surgical masks are appropriate to be used during surgery. Surgical masks may be labeled as surgical, isolation, dental, or medical procedure masks. Chinese health officials distinguish between medical (non-surgical) and surgical masks. Surgical masks are made of a nonwoven fabric created using a melt blowing process. They came into use in the 1960s and largely replaced cloth facemasks in developed countries. The use of surgical masks during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a subject of debate, as shortages of surgical masks is a central issue.Surgical masks are popularly worn by the general public all year round in East Asian countries like China, Japan and South Korea to reduce the chance of spreading airborne diseases to others, and to prevent the breathing in of airborne dust particles created by air pollution. Additionally, surgical masks have become a fashion statement, particularly in contemporary East Asian culture bolstered by its popularity in Japanese and Korean pop culture which have a big impact on East Asian youth culture.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_masks,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Attire102756098|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Clothing103051540|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Commodity103076708|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ConsumerGoods103093574|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Covering103122748|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Disguise103206718|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Mask103724870|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMasks|http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

The established technique is to dip the needle in the vaccine, and then puncture a person's upper arm fifteen times in a small circular area. When done correctly a trace of blood appears at the vaccination site. The bifurcated needle was created as a more efficient and cost effective alternative to the jet injector previously in use. It was invented in 1965 by Dr. Benjamin Rubin, working at Wyeth Laboratories, and was the primary instrument used during the World Health Organization's 1966–1977 campaign to eradicate smallpox. Rubin estimated that it was used to administer 200 million vaccinations per year during the final years of the campaign. After the September 11, 2001 attacks and subsequent anthrax scares, the US government ordered the smallpox vaccine be available for every person in the country. Precision Medical Products, Inc. was awarded the contract to make the bifurcated needles to go along with the vaccine and made over 400,000,000 of these needles in a two year span.

In an emulsion, one liquid (the dispersed phase) is dispersed in the other (the continuous phase). Examples of emulsions include vinaigrettes, homogenized milk, and some cutting fluids for metal working. Two liquids can form different types of emulsions. As an example, oil and water can form, first, an oil-in-water emulsion, in which the oil is the dispersed phase, and water is the continuous phase. (Lipoproteins, used by all complex living organisms, are one example of this.) Second, they can form a water-in-oil emulsion, in which water is the dispersed phase and oil is the continuous phase. Multiple emulsions are also possible, including a ""water-in-oil-in-water"" emulsion and an ""oil-in-water-in-oil"" emulsion. Emulsions, being liquids, do not exhibit a static internal structure. The droplets dispersed in the continuous phase (sometimes referred to as the “dispersion medium”) are usually assumed to be statistically distributed. The term ""emulsion"" is also used to refer to the photo-sensitive side of photographic film. Such a photographic emulsion consists of silver halide colloidal particles dispersed in a gelatin matrix.

However, one third of deaf children do not develop language if they are on a CI program alone and have no sign language input.",literal,en,"A cochlear implant (CI) is a surgically implanted neuroprosthetic device to provide a person with moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss a modified sense of sound. CI bypasses the normal acoustic hearing process to replace it with electric signals which directly stimulate the auditory nerve. A person with a cochlear implant receiving intensive auditory training may learn to interpret those signals as sound and speech. However, one third of deaf children do not develop language if they are on a CI program alone and have no sign language input. The implant has two main components. The outside component is generally worn behind the ear, but could also be attached to clothing, for example, in young children. This component, the sound processor, contains microphones, electronics that include Digital Signal Processor chips, battery, and a coil which transmits a signal to the implant across the skin. The inside component, the actual implant, has a coil to receive signals, electronics, and an array of electrodes which is placed into the cochlea, which stimulate the cochlear nerve. The surgical procedure is performed under general anesthesia. Surgical risks are minimal but can include tinnitus, facial nerve bruising and dizziness. From the early days of implants in the 1970s and the 1980s, speech perception via an implant has steadily increased. Many users of modern implants gain reasonable to good hearing and speech perception skills post-implantation, especially when combined with lipreading. However, for pre-lingually deaf children the risk of not acquiring spoken language even with an implant may be as high as 30%. One of the challenges that remain with these implants is that hearing and speech understanding skills after implantation show a wide range of variation across individual implant users. Factors such as duration and cause of hearing loss, how the implant is situated in the cochlea, the overall health of the cochlear nerve, but also individual capabilities of re-learning are considered to contribute to this variation, yet no certain predictive factors are known. Despite providing the ability for hearing and oral speech communication to children and adults with severe to profound hearing loss, there is also controversy around the devices. Much of the strongest objection to cochlear implants has come from the Deaf community. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which as some view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine)|http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroprosthetics,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ability105616246|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Application100949134|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Creativity105624700|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Invention105633385|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Occupation100582388|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Profession100609953|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Technology100949619|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Use100947128|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatAustralianInventions|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatNASASpin-offTechnologies|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity|http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength. Titanium is resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine. Titanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth after the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of mineral deposits, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere; it is found in almost all living things, as well as bodies of water, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene. Titanium can be alloyed with iron, aluminium, vanadium, and molybdenum, among other elements, to produce strong, lightweight alloys for aerospace (jet engines, missiles, and spacecraft), military, industrial processes (chemicals and petrochemicals, desalination plants, pulp, and paper), automotive, agriculture (farming), medical prostheses, orthopedic implants, dental and endodontic instruments and files, dental implants, sporting goods, jewelry, mobile phones, and other applications. The two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio, the highest of any metallic element. In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but less dense. There are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element, 46Ti through 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8%). Although they have the same number of valence electrons and are in the same group in the periodic table, titanium and zirconium differ in many chemical and physical properties.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing|http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing

The immortality technology is limited to taking young children and turning them into cyborgs. The time travel technology only allows journeys into the past, and returns to the present. No artifacts or people can be brought forward from their own times. In addition, the technology is expensive and dangerous for normal humans to use. History, or at least recorded history, cannot be changed. Dr. Zeus cannot save Lincoln, warn the Titanic, prevent the sack of Rome, or stop the burning of the Library at Alexandria. It can take valuable artifacts thought to be lost in these and other events, hide them and 'rediscover' them in the future. However, even without the dangers of time travel, Dr. Zeus' employees hate the past. By their time, all stimulants and narcotics are illegal, vegetarianism is compulsory, and they are disease- and dirt-phobic. They find the past's inhabitants disgusting. To carry out its mission, Dr. Zeus sends its employees far into human prehistory, where they take children from Neanderthal and modern human families and give them the immortality treatment. These individuals are then promised a bright future in the 24th century, in exchange for working for the Company till then. Their job is to preserve cultural artifacts, valuable plants, and endangered species, hiding them in safe places till the Company can 'recover' them in the future. The cyborgs will get to the 24th century the old-fashioned way, by living through the intervening millennia. Along the way they can create others to help them, using children who would otherwise die and not affect history. They are also provided with many recordings of future culture, entertainment, and a carefully edited view of history. Dr. Zeus alone knows everything that will happen up till the 24th century. As the series progresses, it becomes apparent that the Dr. Zeus story is itself a fiction. How they came by their technology, and how long the Company has really existed, is an unfolding mystery. Furthermore, not even Dr. Zeus knows what happens after July 9, 2355; although it is possible to send messages to the past, there is nothing from beyond that date.

The basis for modern dental implants is a biologic process called osseointegration, in which materials such as titanium form an intimate bond to bone.

A variable amount of healing time is required for osseointegration before either the dental prosthetic (a tooth, bridge or denture) is attached to the implant or an abutment is placed which will hold a dental prosthetic/crown. Success or failure of implants depends on the health of the person receiving the treatment, drugs which affect the chances of osseointegration, and the health of the tissues in the mouth. The amount of stress that will be put on the implant and fixture during normal function is also evaluated. Planning the position and number of implants is key to the long-term health of the prosthetic since biomechanical forces created during chewing can be significant. The position of implants is determined by the position and angle of adjacent teeth, by lab simulations or by using computed tomography with CAD/CAM simulations and surgical guides called stents. The prerequisites for long-term success of osseointegrated dental implants are healthy bone and gingiva. Since both can atrophy after tooth extraction, pre-prosthetic procedures such as sinus lifts or gingival grafts are sometimes required to recreate ideal bone and gingiva. The final prosthetic can be either fixed, where a person cannot remove the denture or teeth from their mouth, or removable, where they can remove the prosthetic. In each case an abutment is attached to the implant fixture. Where the prosthetic is fixed, the crown, bridge or denture is fixed to the abutment either with lag screws or with dental cement. Where the prosthetic is removable, a corresponding adapter is placed in the prosthetic so that the two pieces can be secured together. The risks and complications related to implant therapy divide into those that occur during surgery (such as excessive bleeding or nerve injury), those that occur in the first six months (such as infection and failure to osseointegrate) and those that occur long-term (such as peri-implantitis and mechanical failures). In the presence of healthy tissues, a well-integrated implant with appropriate biomechanical loads can have 5-year plus survival rates from 93 to 98 percent and 10 to 15 year lifespans for the prosthetic teeth. Long-term studies show a 16- to 20-year success (implants surviving without complications or revisions) between 52% and 76%, with complications occurring up to 48% of the time.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MedicalProcedure101024392|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Operation100671351|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDentalMaterials|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSurgicalProcedures|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity|http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

It's indicated for issues such as heart block, slow heart rate, and asynchronous heart ventricle contractions. The biological pacemaker is intended as an alternative to the artificial cardiac pacemaker that's been in human use since the late 1950s. Despite their success, several limitations and problems with artificial pacemakers have emerged during the past decades such as electrode fracture or damage to insulation, infection, re-operations for battery exchange, and venous thrombosis. The need for an alternative is most obvious in children, including premature newborn babies, where size mismatch and the fact that pacemaker leads do not grow with children are a problem. A more biological approach has been taken in order to mitigate many of these issues. However, the implanted biological pacemaker cells still typically need to be supplemented with an artificial pacemaker while the cells form the necessary electrical connections with cardiac tissue.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine)|http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroprosthetics,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Corrective103111899|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Implant103563710|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Prosthesis104013729|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/System104377057|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatEmbeddedSystems|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatImplants

It consists of a zirconium alloy metal substrate that transitions into a ceramic zirconium oxide outer surface. The ceramic surface is extremely abrasion resistant compared to traditional metal implant materials such as cobalt chromium. It also has a lower coefficient of friction against ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), the typical counterface material used in total joint replacements. These two factors likely contribute to the significantly lower UHMWPE wear rates observed in simulator testing. Reducing UHMWPE wear is thought to decrease the risk of implant failure due to osteolysis. All-ceramic materials can have a similar effect on reducing wear, but are brittle and difficult to manufacture. The metal substrate of Oxinium implants makes components easier to manufacture and gives them greater toughness (a combination of strength and ductility). In essence, this technology combines the abrasion resistance and low friction of a ceramic with the workability and toughness of a metal. This combination of properties led to Oxinium technology being the first ever implant-related technology to win the prestigious ASM International Engineering Materials Achievement Award (EMAA) in 2005. Current competitive reduced-wear options in total hip arthroplasty (THA) are ceramic-on-ceramic, metal-on-metal, and metal-on-cross-linked polyethylene. The only competitive reduced-wear option for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is metal-on-cross-linked polyethylene.

Actual applications of Self-microemulsifying drug delivery system' (SMEDDS) remain rare. The first drug marketed as a SMEDDS was cyclosporin, and it had significantly improved bioavailability compared with the conventional solution. In the last decade, several SMEDDS loaded with antiviral drugs (ritonavir, saquinavir) were tested for treatment of HIV infection, but the relative improvement in clinical benefit was not significant. The SMEDDS formulation of ritonavir (soft capsules) has been withdrawn in some countries. Within the last years SMEDDS were also utilized for the oral administration of biologics. Due to ion pairing with appropriate surfactants  these mainly hydrophilic macromolecular drugs can be incorporated in the lipophilic phase of SMEDDS. Provided that the oily droplets being formed in the gut are sufficiently stable towards lipases, can permeate the mucus gel layer in sufficient quantities  and exhibit permeation enhancing properties  the oral bioavailability of various biologics can be strongly improved SMEDDS offer numerous advantages: spontaneous formation, ease of manufacture, thermodynamic stability, and improved solubilization of bioactive materials. Improved solubility contributes to faster release rates and greater bioavailability. For many drugs taken by mouth, faster release rates improve the drug acceptance by consumers. Greater bioavailability means that less drug need be used; this may lower cost, and does lower the stomach irritation and toxicity of drugs taken by mouth. For oral use, SMEDDS may be formulated as liquids or solids, the solids packaged in capsules or tablets. Limited studies comparing these report that in terms of bioavailability liquid SMEDDS are superior to solid SMEDDS, which are superior to conventional tablets. Liquid SMEDDS have also shown value in injectable (IV and urethral) formulations and in a topical (oral) spray.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDrugDeliveryDevices

These animal-drawn versions were the fore-runners of the invalid carriage. James Heath, of Bath, who flourished before the middle of the 18th century, was the inventor of the bath chair. Later versions were a type of wheelchair which is pushed by an attendant rather than pulled by an animal. In the 19th century they were often seen at spa resorts such as Buxton and Tunbridge Wells.

While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, including humans, they might also conceivably be any kind of organism. D. S.

In science fiction, the most recognizable portrayal of a cyborg is a human being with visibly mechanical parts, such as the superhero Cyborg from DC Comics or the Borg from Star Trek. But cyborgs may also be portrayed as looking more like robots or more like ordinary humans. Cyborgs may appear as humanoid robots, such as Robotman from DC's Doom Patrol or the Cybermen from Doctor Who, or they may appear as non-humanoid robots, such as the Daleks in Doctor Who or some of the Motorball players in Battle Angel Alita. More human appearing cyborgs may cover up their mechanical parts with armor or clothing, such as Darth Vader from Star Wars or Misty Knight from Marvel Comics. Cyborgs may even have mechanical parts or bodies that appear human. The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman had bionic parts that looked like the body parts they replaced. Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell is a full-body cyborg whose body looks human. In the examples mentioned, as well as many more, it is common for cyborgs to have physical or mental abilities beyond what humans are capable of.

In women with a prior spontaneous preterm birth and who are pregnant with one baby, and have shortening of the cervical length less than 25 mm, a cerclage prevents a preterm birth and reduces death and illness in the baby. The treatment consists of a strong suture sewn into and around the cervix early in the pregnancy, usually between weeks 12 to 14, and then removed towards the end of the pregnancy when the greatest risk of miscarriage has passed. The procedure is performed under local anaesthesia, usually by way of a spinal block. It is typically performed on an outpatient basis by an obstetrician-gynecologist. Usually the treatment is done in the first or second trimester of pregnancy, for a woman who has had one or more late miscarriages in the past. The word ""cerclage"" means ""hoop"" in French, as in the metal hoop encircling a barrel. There is no evidence that cerclage is effective in a multiple gestation pregnancy for preventing preterm births and reducing perinatal deaths or neonatal morbidity. The success rate for cervical cerclage is approximately 80-90% for elective cerclages, and 40-60% for emergency cerclages. A cerclage is considered successful if labor and delivery is delayed to at least 37 weeks (full term). After the cerclage has been placed, the patient will be observed for at least several hours (sometimes overnight) to ensure that she does not go into premature labor. The patient will then be allowed to return home, but will be instructed to remain in bed or avoid physical activity (including sexual intercourse) for two to three days, or up to two weeks. Follow-up appointments will usually take place so that her doctor can monitor the cervix and stitch and watch for signs of premature labor. For women who are pregnant with one baby (a singleton pregnancy) and at risk for a preterm birth, when cerclage is compared with no treatment, there is a reduction in preterm birth and there may be a reduction in the number of babies who die (perinatal mortality) There is no evidence that cerclage is effective in a multiple gestation pregnancy for preventing preterm births and reducing perinatal deaths or neonatal morbidity.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Content105809192|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Issue105814650|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatHealthIssuesInPregnancy|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

VADs are designed to assist either the right ventricle (RVAD) or the left ventricle (LVAD), or to assist both ventricles (BiVAD). The type of ventricular assistance device applied depends upon the type of underlying heart disease, and upon the pulmonary arterial resistance, which determines the workload of the right ventricle. The left ventricle assistance device (LVAD) is the most common device applied to a defective heart (it is sufficient in most cases; the right side of the heart is then often able to make use of the heavily increased blood flow), but when the pulmonary arterial resistance is high, then an (additional) right ventricle assistance device (RVAD) might be necessary to resolve the problem of cardiac circulation. If both a LVAD and a RVAD is needed a BiVAD is normally used, rather than a separate LVAD and an RVAD. Normally, the long-term VAD is used as a bridge to transplantation (BTT)—keeping the patient alive, and in reasonably good condition, and able to await the heart transplant outside of the hospital.Other ""bridges"" include bridge to candidacy, bridge to decision, and bridge to recovery.In some instances VADs are also used as destination therapy (DT).

Prolific inventors in thin film drug delivery include Richard Fuisz, Joseph Fuisz, Garry Myers and Robert Yang. This group has contributed over thirty patents in this field. Thin-film drug delivery has emerged as an advanced alternative to the traditional tablets, capsules and liquids often associated with prescription and OTC medications. Similar in size, shape and thickness to a postage stamp, thin-film strips are typically designed for oral administration, with the user placing the strip on or under the tongue (sublingual) or along the inside of the cheek (buccal). These drug delivery options allow the medication to bypass the first pass metabolism thereby making the medication more bioavailable. As the strip dissolves, the drug can enter the blood stream enterically, buccally or sublingually. Evaluating the systemic transmucosal drug delivery, the buccal mucosa is the preferred region as compared to the sublingual mucosa. Different buccal delivery products have been marketed or are proposed for certain diseases like trigeminal neuralgia, Meniere's disease, diabetes, and addiction. There are many commercial non-drug product to use thin films like Mr. Mint and Listerine PocketPaks breath freshening strips. Since then, thin-film products for other breath fresheners, as well as a number of cold, flu, anti-snoring and gastrointestinal medications, have entered the marketplace. There are currently several projects in development that will deliver prescription drugs using the thin-film dosage form.

The AL is intended to take over some of the functionality of biological lungs. It is different from a heart-lung machine in that it is external and designed to take over the functions of the lungs for long periods of time rather than on a temporary basis. The heart-lung machine inspired the design of AL devices, however, modern ALs are optimised to minimize patient trauma. Following the development of the heart-lung machine, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) was developed. This was intended to be used as a bridge to lung transplant (BTT), for patients too sick to wait until a donor lung was available. Mechanical Ventilation (MV) has also been used, however, it is damaging to the patient's lungs if used for extended periods of time. Both these therapies are expensive and are associated with poor quality of life, in part due to complex blood circuits required for these techniques to work. Recent developments include simplifying the ECMO system, and devices that use 380 micron wide hollow fibers to simulate the function of alveoli have been developed. Several research groups, notably, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Michigan, University of Maryland and Boston based groups are developing AL devices to bridge patients to lung transplant.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/BodyPart105220461|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Organ105297523|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part109385911|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thing100002452|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatArtificialOrgans

In the case of cigarette smoking these substances are contained in a mixture of aerosol particles and gases and include the pharmacologically active alkaloid nicotine; the vaporization creates heated aerosol and gas into a form that allows inhalation and deep penetration into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream of the active substances occurs. In some cultures, smoking is also carried out as a part of various rituals, where participants use it to help induce trance-like states that, they believe, can lead them to spiritual enlightenment. Smoking generally has negative health effects, because smoke inhalation inherently poses challenges to various physiologic processes such as respiration. Diseases related to tobacco smoking have been shown to kill approximately half of long-term smokers when compared to average mortality rates faced by non-smokers. Smoking caused over five million deaths a year from 1990 to 2015. Smoking is one of the most common forms of recreational drug use. Tobacco smoking is the most popular form, being practised by over one billion people globally, of whom the majority are in the developing countries. Less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium. Some of the substances are classified as hard narcotics, like heroin, but the use of these is very limited as they are usually not commercially available. Cigarettes are primarily industrially manufactured but also can be hand-rolled from loose tobacco and rolling paper. Other smoking implements include pipes, cigars, bidis, hookahs, and bongs. Smoking can be dated to as early as 5000 BCE, and has been recorded in many different cultures across the world. Early smoking evolved in association with religious ceremonies; as offerings to deities, in cleansing rituals or to allow shamans and priests to alter their minds for purposes of divination or spiritual enlightenment. After the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, the practice of smoking tobacco quickly spread to the rest of the world. In regions like India and Sub-Saharan Africa, it merged with existing practices of smoking (mostly of cannabis). In Europe, it introduced a new type of social activity and a form of drug intake which previously had been unknown. Perception surrounding smoking has varied over time and from one place to another: holy and sinful, sophisticated and vulgar, a panacea and deadly health hazard. In the 20th century, smoking came to be viewed in a decidedly negative light, especially in Western countries. This is due to smoking tobacco being among the leading causes of many diseases such as lung cancer, heart attack, COPD, erectile dysfunction, and birth defects. The health hazards of smoking have caused many countries to institute high taxes on tobacco products, run ads to discourage use, limit ads that promote use, and provide help with quitting for those who do smoke.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Another popular brand name of PTFE is Syncolon by Synco Chemical Corporation. PTFE is a fluorocarbon solid, as it is a high molecular weight compound consisting wholly of carbon and fluorine. PTFE is hydrophobic: neither water nor water-containing substances wet PTFE, as fluorocarbons demonstrate mitigated London dispersion forces due to the high electronegativity of fluorine. PTFE has one of the lowest coefficients of friction of any solid. PTFE is used as a non-stick coating for pans and other cookware. It is non-reactive, partly because of the strength of carbon–fluorine bonds, and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. Where used as a lubricant, PTFE reduces friction, wear, and energy consumption of machinery. It is commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions. It is also frequently employed as coating on catheters; this interferes with the ability of bacteria and other infectious agents to adhere to catheters and cause hospital-acquired infections.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ChemicalCompound|http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ChemicalSubstance|http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Drug|http://umbel.org/umbel/rc/ChemicalSubstanceType|http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#ChemicalObject|http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing|http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11173

In the United States, lift chairs qualify as Durable Medical Equipment under Medicare Part B. In a February 1989 report released by the Inspector General of the US Department of Health and Human Services, it was found that: lift chairs might not possibly meet Medicare's requirements for Durable Medical Equipment (DME) and lift chair claims need to be re-regulated. The report was stimulated by an increase in lift chair claims between 1984 and 1985 from 200,000 to 700,000. A New York Times article stated that aggressive TV ads were pushing consumers to inquire about lift chairs and, once consumers called in, a form was sent to them for their physicians to sign. Some companies would ship lift chairs before receiving a physician's signature; therefore, forcing the physicians to sign or else their patient will be forced to pay for the chair. Medicare may only cover the cost of the lift-mechanism rather than the entire chair. Before Medicare can be considered for covering the cost, patients will need to have a visit with their physician to discuss the need for this particular equipment. The DME provider will then request a prescription and a certificate of medical necessity (CMN). The CMN typical involves five questions that the physician needs to answer. Typically, the questions are (1) Does the patient have severe arthritis, (2) Does the patient have a neuromuscular disease, (3) Is the patient incapable of getting up from a regular chair in their home, (4) Can the patient walk once standing, and (5) Have all other therapeutic measures been taken? If any of the questions are answered ""NO"", it may likely result in a denial of the claim.

Different types of stainless steel include the elements carbon (from 0.03% to greater than 1.00%), nitrogen, aluminium, silicon, sulfur, titanium, nickel, copper, selenium, niobium, and molybdenum. Specific types of stainless steel are often designated by a three-digit number, e.g., 304 stainless. Stainless steel's resistance to ferric oxide formation results from the presence of chromium in the alloy, which forms a passive film that protects the underlying material from corrosion attack, and can self-heal in the presence of oxygen. Corrosion resistance can be increased further, by: 
* increasing the chromium content to levels above 11%; 
* addition of 8% or higher amounts of nickel; and 
* addition of molybdenum (which also improves resistance to ""pitting corrosion""). The addition of nitrogen also improves resistance to pitting corrosion and increases mechanical strength. Thus, there are numerous grades of stainless steel with varying chromium and molybdenum contents to suit the environment the alloy must endure. Resistance to corrosion and staining, low maintenance, and familiar luster make stainless steel an ideal material for many applications where both the strength of steel and corrosion resistance are required. Moreover, stainless steel can be rolled into sheets, plates, bars, wire, and tubing. These can be used in cookware, cutlery, surgical instruments, major appliances, construction material in large buildings, industrial equipment (e.g., in paper mills, chemical plants, water treatment), and storage tanks and tankers for chemicals and food products. The material's corrosion resistance, the ease with which it can be steam-cleaned and sterilized, and the absence of the need for surface coatings have prompted the use of stainless steel in kitchens and food processing plants.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Ramps permit wheelchair users, as well as people pushing strollers, carts, or other wheeled objects, to more easily access a building. A wheelchair ramp can be permanent, semi-permanent or portable. Permanent ramps are designed to be bolted or otherwise attached in place. Semi-permanent ramps rest on top of the ground or concrete pad and are commonly used for the short term. Permanent and semi-permanent ramps are usually of aluminum, concrete or wood. Portable ramps are usually aluminum and typically fold for ease of transport. Portable ramps are primarily intended for home and building use but can also be used with vans to load an unoccupied mobility device or to load an occupied mobility device when both the device and the passenger are easy to handle. Ramps must be carefully designed in order to be useful. In many places, laws dictate a ramp's minimum width and maximum slope. In general, reduced incline rises are easier for wheelchair users to traverse and are safer in icy climates. However, they consume more space and require traveling a greater distance to go up. Hence, in some cases it is preferable to include an elevator or other type of wheelchair lift. In many countries, wheelchair ramps and other features to facilitate universal access are required by building code when constructing new facilities which are open to the public.

Most implanted pacemakers are dual chambered and have two leads, causing the implantation time to take longer because of this more complicated pacemaker system. These factors can contribute to an increased rate of complications which can lead to pacemaker failure. Approximately 2.25 million pacemakers were implanted in the United States between 1990 and 2002, and of those pacemakers, about 8,834 were removed from patients because of device malfunction most commonly connected to generator abnormalities. In the 1970s, results of an Oregon study indicated that 10% of implanted pacemakers failed within the first month. Another study found that more than half of pacemaker complications occurred during the first 3 months after implantation. Causes of pacemaker failure include lead related failure, unit malfunction, problems at the insertion site, failures related to exposure to high voltage electricity or high intensity microwaves, and a miscellaneous category (one patient had ventricular tachycardia when using his electric razor and another patient had persistent pacing of the diaphragm muscle). Pacemaker malfunction has the ability to cause serious injury or death, but if detected early enough, patients can continue with their needed therapy once complications are resolved.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Corrective103111899|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Implant103563710|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Prosthesis104013729|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/System104377057|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatEmbeddedSystems|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatImplants|http://umbel.org/umbel/rc/AilmentCondition

The other principal type of manual resuscitator (flow-inflation) is heavily used in non-emergency applications in the operating room to ventilate patients during anesthesia induction and recovery. Use of manual resuscitators to ventilate a patient is frequently called ""bagging"" the patient and is regularly necessary in medical emergencies when the patient's breathing is insufficient (respiratory failure) or has ceased completely (respiratory arrest). Use of the manual resuscitator force-feeds air or oxygen into the lungs in order to inflate them under pressure, thus constituting a means to manually provide positive-pressure ventilation.

It was signed into law on September 27, 2007, as part of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. (The EU acted to adopt UDI and on April 5th, 2017, under the EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and In-vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR), but adoption has been postponed; see Medical Device Regulation.) This act includes language related to the establishment of a Unique Device Identification System. When implemented, the new system will require: 
* The label of a device to bear a unique identifier, unless an alternative location is specified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or unless an exception is made for a particular device or group of devices. 
* The unique identifier to be able to identify the device through distribution and use 
* The unique identifier to include the lot or serial number if specified by FDA A national UDI system will create a common vocabulary for reporting and enhance electronic tracking abilities. Currently, analysis of adverse event reports is limited by the fact that the specific devices involved in an incident are often not known with the required degree of specificity. Without a common vocabulary for medical devices, meaningful analysis based on data from existing voluntary systems is problematic. Reliable and consistent identification of medical devices would enable safety surveillance so that the FDA and manufacturers could better identify potential problems or device defects, and improve patient care. The UDI is expected to improve patient safety (in part by helping to identify counterfeit products and by improving the ability of staff to distinguish between devices that are similar in appearance but serve different functions), facilitate and improve the recall process, and create efficiences within the medical system. In the most basic format, the UDI would be a coded number registered with standards organizations, and would incorporate a variety of information, including (but not limited to) the manufacturer of the device, expiry dates, the make and model of the device, and any special attributes that the device may possess. In a medical sense, ""device"" refers to any product that is not pharmaceutical in nature, and while the FDA have been given approval to exempt some devices, Jay Crowely (who was responsible for implementing the UDI requirements in the Act), has expressed an intent to apply the UDI to ""everything until somebody gives us good reason not to"", (excluding devices which won't need identification). Following the passing of the Act, there were calls for the FDA to publish a timeline for the implementation of the UDI; this was subsequently done. GUDID SubmissionThe Final Rule on Unique Device Identifiers also mandates medical device manufacturers to make a submission to the FDA's Global Unique Device Identification Database. The submission to the GUDID will include the Primary Device Identifier portion of the UDI as well as associated data attributes about each model or version number of the device. Compliance with the submission component of UDI compliance is phased according to the Class of device. Class III device labelers must submit to the GUDID for all existing products by September 24, 2014. Labelers of Implantable, Life Supporting or Life Sustaining devices must submit to the GUDID by September 24, 2015. Class II labelers must comply with submission guidelines by September 24, 2016, and Class I labelers by September 24, 2018. Submission to the GUDID may be made in one of two methods. The first method utilizes the FDA's GUDID Web Interface, which is meant for low volumes of GUDID submissions. The second method utilizes an HL7 SPL submission and is transmitted to the FDA through an Electronic Submission Gateway account. Once the initial submission is made, labelers of medical devices must update the GUDID submission each time there is a change to the device attributes. While many device attributes may be updated once the device record is published within the GUDID, several attributes cannot be changed and will necessitate the labeler deactivate the existing submission and resubmit using a new Device Identifier.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Regulation_of_medical_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Communication100033020|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Identifier107270601|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Signal106791372|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Symbol106806469|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatIdentifiers

Additionally, public health agencies of some countries and territories have changed their recommendations regarding face masks over time. Face masks have been a subject of shortages, and not all have been certified. Moreover, substandard masks were reported on the market with significantly reduced performance.

Wheelchair lifts can be installed in homes or businesses and are often added to both private and public vehicles in order to meet accessibility requirements laid out by disability acts. These mobility devices are often installed in homes as an alternative to a stair lift, which only transport a passenger and not his/her wheelchair or mobility scooter. In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) required that all new mass transit vehicles placed into service after July 1, 1993, be accessible to persons in wheelchairs, and until the 2000s, this requirement was most commonly met by the inclusion of a wheelchair lift. In 1993, there were 29,033 transit buses in the U.S. equipped with wheelchair lifts or ramps, representing 52 percent of all U.S. transit buses. By 2001, this figure had grown to 58,785 buses (although the percentage that were equipped with lifts, as opposed to ramps, is unknown). Low-floor transit vehicles (buses, streetcars, light rail cars) – fitted with ramps or bridge plates rather than lifts – later began to become more common than lifts for heavy-duty transit vehicles, while lifts continue to be used in paratransit vehicles. A number of legal regimes in various countries regulate the use of wheelchair lifts, setting forth standards for the devices and requiring certain kinds of businesses to make parking lots accessible to vehicles bearing the devices. In some instances, accessibility standards have been achieved in legal settlements. For example, in the 2005 case of Dilworth, et al. v. City of Detroit, NO. 2:04- cv-73152 (E.D. Mich. 2005), the defendant city conceded that the Americans With Disabilities Act and its supporting legislation required the city ""to maintain the wheelchair lifts on its buses in operative condition; promptly repair wheelchair lifts if they are damaged or out of order; establish a system of regular and frequent maintenance checks of wheelchair lifts; remove a vehicle from service if the lift is inoperative (with limited exceptions); provide alternative transportation when the lift doesn't work and the next accessible bus is more than 30 minutes away."" While some wheelchair-accessible vans use a powered lift to assist the occupant in boarding, a wheelchair ramp is usually less expensive for this purpose and is often installed on minivans. Full-size vans require the use of a platform lift. There are two types of platform lifts installed on wheelchair-accessible vans: single-arm and dual-arm. Single-arm wheelchair lifts are only used in side-entry applications. They take up less interior space and leave the passenger entry open; however, they have less lifting capacity than dual-arm lifts. Most dual-arm wheelchair lifts have a lift capacity up to 800 pounds. These lifts consume more interior space and block the side entry and, for these reasons, are often mounted in the back of the vehicle for rear-entry applications. As mandated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), wheelchair-accessible vans with wheelchair lifts are equipped with a safety lift interlock. Designed to prevent operation of the wheelchair van or wheelchair lift in unsafe situations, the safety interlock will sound an alarm if an unsafe condition exists (e.g., the vehicle attempts to move while the lift is deployed) or prevent the vehicle from shifting into drive while the wheelchair lift is in operation. In 2002, innovations allowed the development of wheelchair lifts that assist people in entering truck cabs, so that they may drive or operate heavy equipment. Wheelchair lifts can also be used to move an unoccupied scooter into a vehicle.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Mobility_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Chair103001627|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Furnishing103405265|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Furniture103405725|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Seat104161981|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Wheelchair104576002|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatWheelchairs

It may also be referred to by the brand names Terylene in the UK, Lavsan in Russia and the former Soviet Union, and Dacron in the US. The majority of the world's PET production is for synthetic fibres (in excess of 60%), with bottle production accounting for about 30% of global demand. In the context of textile applications, PET is referred to by its common name, polyester, whereas the acronym PET is generally used in relation to packaging. Polyester makes up about 18% of world polymer production and is the fourth-most-produced polymer after polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). PET consists of polymerized units of the monomer ethylene terephthalate, with repeating (C10H8O4) units. PET is commonly recycled, and has the number ""1"" as its resin identification code (RIC). Depending on its processing and thermal history, polyethylene terephthalate may exist both as an amorphous (transparent) and as a semi-crystalline polymer. The semicrystalline material might appear transparent (particle size less than 500 nm) or opaque and white (particle size up to a few micrometers) depending on its crystal structure and particle size. The monomer bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate can be synthesized by the esterification reaction between terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol with water as a byproduct, or by transesterification reaction between ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) with methanol as a byproduct. Polymerization is through a polycondensation reaction of the monomers (done immediately after esterification/transesterification) with water as the byproduct.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ability105616246|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/AromaticCompound114610088|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Chemical114806838|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Compound114818238|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Creativity105624700|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ester114850483|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Fiber114866889|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Hydrocarbon114911057|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Invention105633385|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Man-madeFiber114959058|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/OrganicCompound114727670|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Polyester114993713|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Polymer114994328|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Resin114894140|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/SyntheticResin114902141|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatAromaticCompounds|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCarboxylateEsters|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatEnglishInventions|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatHouseholdChemicals|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatPolyesters|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatPolymers|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSyntheticFibers|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatTransparentMaterials|http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ChemicalCompound|http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ChemicalSubstance|http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Drug|http://umbel.org/umbel/rc/ChemicalSubstanceType|http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#ChemicalObject|http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing|http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11173

CRT is indicated in patients suffering from a low ejection fraction (typically <35%) indicating heart failure, where electrical activity has been compromised, with prolonged QRS duration to >120 ms. The insertion of electrodes into the ventricles is done under local anesthetic, with access to the ventricles most commonly via the subclavian vein, although access may be conferred from the axillary or cephalic veins. Right ventricular access is direct, while left ventricular access is conferred via the coronary sinus (CS).

The ICD is the first-line treatment and prophylactic therapy for patients at risk for sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Current devices can be programmed to detect abnormal heart rhythms and deliver therapy via programmable antitachycardia pacing in addition to low-energy and high-energy shocks. ""AICD"" was trademarked by the Boston Scientific corporation, so the more generic ""ICD"" is preferred terminology. Current device batteries last about 6–10 years, With advances in the technology (batteries with more capacity or, potentially in the future with rechargeable batteries) it may be possible to increase this well past 10 years. The lead (the electrical cable connecting the device to the heart) has a much longer average longevity but can incur various types of malfunction, specifically insulation failure or fracture of the conductor and require replacement. The process of implantation of an ICD system is similar to implantation of a pacemaker. In fact, ICDs are composed of an ICD generator and of wires. The first component or generator, contains a computer chip or circuitry with RAM (memory), programmable software, a capacitor and a battery; this is implanted typically under the skin in the left upper chest. The second part of the system is an electrode wire or wires that, similar to pacemakers, are connected to the generator and passed through a vein to the right chambers of the heart. The lead usually lodges in the apex or septum of the right ventricle. Just like pacemakers, ICDs can have a single wire or lead in the heart (in the right ventricle, single chamber ICD), two leads (in the right atrium and right ventricle, dual chamber ICD) or three leads (biventricular ICD, one in the right atrium, one in the right ventricle and one on the outer wall of the left ventricle). The difference between pacemakers and ICDs is that pacemakers are also available as temporary units and are generally designed to correct slow heart rates, i.e. bradycardia, while ICDs are often permanent safeguards against sudden life-threatening arrhythmias. Recent developments include the subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD), and the ability to pace the left ventricle from multiple sites near-simultaneously with Multipoint Pacing (Abbott).",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine)|http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroprosthetics,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Care100654885|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Crisis107417644|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Emergency107417405|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Happening107283608|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Juncture107416714|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Treatment100658082|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCardiacProcedures|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalEmergencies|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTreatments|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Work100575741|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

IOLs usually consist of a small plastic lens with plastic side struts, called haptics, to hold the lens in place in the capsular bag inside the eye. IOLs were conventionally made of an inflexible material (PMMA), although this has largely been superseded by the use of flexible materials, such as silicone and acrylic glass. Most IOLs fitted today are fixed monofocal lenses matched to distance vision. However, other types are available, such as multifocal IOLs that provide the patient with multiple-focused vision at far and reading distance, and adaptive IOLs that provide the patient with limited visual accommodation. Surgeons annually implant more than 6 million lenses. The procedure can be done under local anesthesia with the patient awake throughout the operation. The use of a flexible IOL enables the lens to be rolled for insertion into the capsule through a very small incision, thus avoiding the need for stitches. This procedure usually takes less than 30 minutes in the hands of an experienced ophthalmologist. The recovery period is about 2–3 weeks. After surgery, patients should avoid strenuous exercise or anything else that significantly increases blood pressure. They should visit their ophthalmologists regularly for several months to monitor the implants. IOL implantation carries several risks associated with eye surgeries, such as infection, loosening of the lens, lens rotation, inflammation and nighttime halos, but a systematic review of studies has determined that the procedure is safer than conventional laser eye treatment. Though IOLs enable many patients to have reduced dependence on glasses, most patients still rely on glasses for certain activities, such as reading.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Attribute100024264|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Condition113920835|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Disorder114052403|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalCondition114034177|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/State100024720|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDisordersOfLens|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

In general, cracks are hard to detect at an early stage, and manual intervention is required for periodic inspections and repairs. In contrast, self-healing materials counter degradation through the initiation of a repair mechanism which responds to the micro-damage. Some self-healing materials are classed as smart structures, and can adapt to various environmental conditions according to their sensing and actuation properties. Although the most common types of self-healing materials are polymers or elastomers, self-healing covers all classes of materials, including metals, ceramics, and cementitious materials. Healing mechanisms vary from an instrinsic repair of the material to the addition of a repair agent contained in a microscopic vessel. For a material to be strictly defined as autonomously self-healing, it is necessary that the healing process occurs without human intervention. Self-healing polymers may, however, activate in response to an external stimulus (light, temperature change, etc.) to initiate the healing processes. A material which can intrinsically correct damage caused by normal usage could prevent costs incurred by material failure and lower costs of a number of different industrial processes through longer part lifetime, and reduction of inefficiency caused by degradation over time.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSmartMaterials

Bone cement chemically is nothing more than Plexiglas (i.e. polymethyl methacrylate or PMMA). PMMA was used clinically for the first time in the 1940s in plastic surgery to close gaps in the skull. Comprehensive clinical tests of the compatibility of bone cements with the body were conducted before their use in surgery. The excellent tissue compatibility of PMMA allowed bone cements to be used for anchorage of head prostheses in the 1950s. Today several million procedures of this type are conducted every year all over the world and more than half of them routinely use bone cements - and the proportion is increasing. Bone cement is considered a reliable anchorage material with its ease of use in clinical practice and particularly because of its proven long survival rate with cemented-in prostheses. Hip and knee registers for artificial joint replacements such as those in Sweden and Norway clearly demonstrate the advantages of cemented-in anchorage. A similar register for endoprosthesis was introduced in Germany in 2010.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MedicalProcedure101024392|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Operation100671351|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatOrthopedicSurgicalProcedures|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSurgicalProcedures|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

The two Vitallium implants were implanted in November 1948 at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, under the newly formed NHS. The 67-year-old implants had such an unusually long life, partly because they had not required the typical replacement of such implants, but also because of Sharp's young age of 23 when they were implanted, owing to a childhood case of septic arthritis. For high-temperature use in engines, particularly turbochargers, the first alloy used was Haynes Stellite No. 21, similar to Vitallium. This was suggested by the British engineer, and denture wearer, S.D. Heron during World War II.

The theatrical Justice League, released by Warner Bros. in 2017, suffered a difficult production. Its script underwent major changes before and during production between 2016 and 2017. In May 2017, Snyder stepped down during post-production following the death of his daughter, and Whedon took over, completing the film as an uncredited director. Whedon oversaw reshoots and other changes that added a brighter tone and more humor, and cut the runtime down to 120 minutes in accordance with a mandate from Warner Bros. The theatrical Justice League was a box-office disappointment and received mixed reviews, leading Warner Bros. to re-evaluate the future of the DCEU and focus development on individual films. As details surfaced about the film's troubled production and its state before Snyder stepped down, many fans expressed interest in an alternate cut more faithful to Snyder's vision. Fans and members of the cast and crew petitioned for the release of this, which they nicknamed the Snyder Cut. At the time, industry insiders regarded the release as unlikely. However, Warner Bros. decided to move ahead with it in February 2020; the following May, Snyder announced that the original cut would be released as Zack Snyder's Justice League via the streaming service HBO Max. The restoration will cost $20–30+ million to complete the visual effects, score, and editing.

Usually mouthwashes are antiseptic solutions intended to reduce the microbial load in the oral cavity, although other mouthwashes might be given for other reasons such as for their analgesic, anti-inflammatory or anti-fungal action. Additionally, some rinses act as saliva substitutes to neutralize acid and keep the mouth moist in xerostomia (dry mouth). Cosmetic mouthrinses temporarily control or reduce bad breath and leave the mouth with a pleasant taste. Rinsing with water or mouthwash after brushing with a fluoride toothpaste can reduce the availability of salivary fluoride. This can lower the anti-cavity re-mineralization and antibacterial effects of fluoride. Fluoridated mouthwash may mitigate this effect or in high concentrations increase available fluoride.

Data of mechanical and biological behaviors of mesh in vivo may not always be concurrent within the human body due to testing in other organisms. Most published reports experiment on mice, thus creating the likelihood of possible differences when inserted into the human body. Also, most published research reports reference meshes that are currently removed from the medical device market due to complications post-surgery.

It is commonly employed in delivery systems of intravenous therapy and acts to prevent air embolism. The use of a drip chamber also allows an estimate of the rate at which fluid is administered. For a fluid of a given viscosity, drips from a hole of known size will be of nearly identical volume, and the number of drips in a minute can be counted to gauge the rate of flow. In this instance the rate of flow is usually controlled by a clamp on the infusion tubing; this affects the resistance to flow. However, other sources of resistance (such as whether the vein is kinked or compressed by the patient's position) cannot be so directly controlled and a change in position may change the rate of flow leading to inadvertently rapid or slow infusion. Where this might be problematic an infusion pump can be used which gives a more accurate measurement of flow rate. Drip chambers can be classified into macro-drip (about 10 to 20 gtts/ml) and micro-drip (about 60 gtts/ml) based on their drop factors. For a given drip chamber (when the fluid drips from the hole into the chamber) drop factor means number of drops per ml of the IV fluid. Flow rate can be calculated with the help of the observations from the drip chamber and its drop factor. The unit of flow rate is gtts/min, where gtts means guttae (Latin plural noun meaning “drops”).",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDrugDeliveryDevices

Or, walking impairment may be due to a later injury or illness, such as a traumatic brain injury, incomplete spinal cord injury or stroke. Regardless of the cause of disability, the child or adult may learn to walk, or recover the ability to walk, through walking practice. Recent discoveries in the field of neuroplasticity indicate the human potential for improvement in motor skills through activity-based therapy, despite neural damage from condition or injury.

Debilitating pain from osteoarthritis is much more common in the elderly. Knee replacement surgery can be performed as a partial or a total knee replacement. In general, the surgery consists of replacing the diseased or damaged joint surfaces of the knee with metal and plastic components shaped to allow continued motion of the knee. The operation typically involves substantial postoperative pain, and includes vigorous physical rehabilitation. The recovery period may be 12 weeks or longer and may involve the use of mobility aids (e.g. walking frames, canes, crutches) to enable the patient's return to preoperative mobility.

This study found that IVC filters reduced the incidence of PE but increased the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). All patients were on anticoagulation drugs during the study. Results from the PREPIC study and other studies which have shown many long-term complications of IVC filters led to the introduction of retrievable IVC filters. The first retrievable IVC filters were approved by FDA in 2003 and 2004. In 2012, the American College of Chest Physicians recommended IVC filters for those with contraindications to anticoagulation who either have acute PE or acute proximal (above the knee) deep vein thrombosis (DVT).",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Care100654885|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Treatment100658082|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTreatments|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatVascularProcedures|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Work100575741|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

Because they can also produce quite high but controlled pressures, they can inject controlled amounts of fluids subcutaneously (beneath the skin), or epidurally (just within the surface of the central nervous system – a very popular local spinal anesthesia for childbirth).",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MechanicalDevice103736970|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Mechanism103738472|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Pump104021798|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDrugDeliveryDevices|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalPumps|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatPumps

Fentanyl is also used as a recreational drug, often mixed with heroin or cocaine. It has a rapid onset and its effects generally last less than two hours. Medically, fentanyl is used by injection, nasal spray, skin patch, or absorbed through the cheek (transmucosal) as a lozenge or tablet. Common side effects include vomiting, constipation, sedation, confusion, hallucinations, and injuries related to poor coordination. Serious side effects may include decreased breathing (respiratory depression), serotonin syndrome, low blood pressure, addiction, or coma. Fentanyl works primarily by activating μ-opioid receptors. It is around 100 times stronger than morphine, and some analogues such as carfentanil are around 10,000 times stronger. Fentanyl was first made by Paul Janssen in 1960 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1968. In 2015, 1,600 kilograms (3,500 lb) were used in healthcare globally. As of 2017, fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in medicine. Fentanyl patches for cancer pain are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2016, fentanyl and analogues were the most common cause of overdose deaths in the United States at more than 20,000, about half of all opioid-related deaths. Most of these overdose deaths were due to illegally made fentanyl. In 2017, it was the 250th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1.7 million prescriptions.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Transdermal_patches,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ability105616246|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/AliphaticCompound114601294|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Amide114724264|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Amine114739004|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/AromaticCompound114610088|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Chemical114806838|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Compound105870180|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Compound114818238|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Concept105835747|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Content105809192|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Creativity105624700|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Hydrocarbon114911057|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Idea105833840|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Invention105633385|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LanguageUnit106284225|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MethaneSeries114951377|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Name106333653|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/OrganicCompound114727670|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/TradeName106845599|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole105869584|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatAmides|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatAromaticAmines|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatAromaticCompounds|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatBelgianInventions|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatJohnson&JohnsonBrands|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatPhenylCompounds|http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ChemicalSubstance|http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Drug|http://umbel.org/umbel/rc/DrugProduct|http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#ChemicalObject|http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing|http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8386

This type of emulsion was named after S.U. Pickering, who described the phenomenon in 1907, although the effect was first recognized by Walter Ramsden in 1903. If oil and water are mixed and small oil droplets are formed and dispersed throughout the water, eventually the droplets will coalesce to decrease the amount of energy in the system. However, if solid particles are added to the mixture, they will bind to the surface of the interface and prevent the droplets from coalescing, making the emulsion more stable. Properties such as hydrophobicity, shape, and size of the particle can have an effect on the stability of the emulsion. The particle’s contact angle to the surface of the droplet is a characteristic of the hydrophobicity. If the contact angle of the particle to the interface is low, the particle will be mostly wetted by the droplet and therefore will not be likely to prevent coalescence of the droplets. Particles that are partially hydrophobic (i.e. contact angle of approximately 90°) are better stabilizers because they are partially wettable by both liquids and therefore bind better to the surface of the droplets. The stabilization energy is given by where r is the particle radius,  is the interfacial tension, and  is the contact angle. When the contact angle is approximately 90°, the energy required to stabilize the system is at its minimum.Generally, the phase that preferentially wets the particle will be the continuous phase in the emulsion system. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the stability of the Pickering emulsions can be improved by the use of amphiphilic ""Janus particles"", namely particles that have one hydrophobic and one hydrophilic side, due to the higher adsorption energy of the particles at the liquid-liquid interface. This is evident when observing emulsion stabilization using polyelectrolytes. Homogenised milk is an example of a Pickering-stabilized emulsion. Casein (protein) units are adsorbed at the surface of milk fat globules and act as a surfactant. The casein replaces the milkfat globule membrane, which is damaged during homogenisation. It is possible to use latex particles for Pickering stabilization and then fuse these particles to form a permeable shell or capsule, called a colloidosome. Moreover, Pickering emulsion droplets are also suitable templates for micro-encapsulation and the formation of closed, non-permeable capsules. This form of encapsulation can also be applied to water-in-water emulsions (dispersions of phase-separated aqueous polymer solutions), and can also be reversible.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Form106290637|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LanguageUnit106284225|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Mixture114586258|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatChemicalMixtures|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDosageForms|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Word106286395

The most clinical experience has been with electrical stimulation. Neuromodulation, whether electrical or magnetic, employs the body's natural biological response by stimulating nerve cell activity that can influence populations of nerves by releasing transmitters, such as dopamine, or other chemical messengers such as the peptide Substance P, that can modulate the excitability and firing patterns of neural circuits. There may also be more direct electrophysiological effects on neural membranes as the mechanism of action of electrical interaction with neural elements. The end effect is a ""normalization"" of a neural network function from its perturbed state. Presumed mechanisms of action for neurostimulation include depolarizing blockade, stochastic normalization of neural firing, , reduction of neural firing keratosis, and suppression of neural network oscillations. Although the exact mechanisms of neurostimulation are not known, the empirical effectiveness has led to considerable application clinically. Existing and emerging neuromodulation treatments also include application in medication-resistant epilepsy, chronic head pain conditions, and functional therapy ranging from bladder and bowel or respiratory control to improvement of sensory deficits, such as hearing (cochlear implants and auditory brainstem implants) and vision (retinal implants). Technical improvements include a trend toward minimally invasive (or noninvasive) systems; as well as smaller, more sophisticated devices that may have automated feedback control, and conditional compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging.

With a DACI, people with no or almost no residual hearing but with a still functioning inner ear, can again perceive speech, sounds and music.DACI is an official product category, as indicated by the nomenclature of GMDN. A DACI tries to provide an answer for people with hearing problems for which no solution exists today. People with some problems at the level of the cochlea can be helped with a hearing aid. A hearing aid will absorb the incoming sound from a microphone, and offer enhanced through the natural way. For larger reinforcements, this may cause problems with feedback and distortion. A hearing aid also simply provides more loudness, no more resolution. Users will view this often as, ""all sounds louder, but I understand nothing more than before.""Once a hearing aid offers no solution anymore, one can switch to a cochlear implant. A Cochlear implant captures the sound and sends it electrically, through the cochlea, to the auditory nerve. In this way, completely deaf patients can perceive sounds again.However, As soon as there are problems not only at the level of the cochlea, but also in the middle ear (the so-called conductive losses), then there are more efficient ways to get sound to the partially functioning cochlea.The most obvious solution is a BAHA, which brings the sound to the cochlea via bone conduction.However, patients who have both problems with the cochlea, as with the middle ear (i.e. patients with mixed losses), none of the above solutions is ideal.To this end, the direct acoustic cochlear implant was developed. A DACI brings the sound directly to the cochlea, and provides the most natural way of sound amplification.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine)|http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroprosthetics,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Corrective103111899|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Implant103563710|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Prosthesis104013729|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatImplants

Different alloys are named according to the weight percentage of Nickel, e.g. Nitinol 55 and Nitinol 60. It exhibits the shape memory effect and superelasticity at different temperatures. Nitinol alloys exhibit two closely related and unique properties: the shape memory effect and superelasticity (also called pseudoelasticity). Shape memory is the ability of nitinol to undergo deformation at one temperature, stay in its deformed shape when the external force is removed, then recover its original, undeformed shape upon heating above its ""transformation temperature"". Superelasticity is the ability for the metal to undergo large deformations and immediately return to its undeformed shape upon removal of the external load. Nitinol can deform 10-30 times as much as ordinary metals and return to its original shape.

The same material can be used as a casting resin or in inks and coatings, among many other uses. Although not a type of familiar silica-based glass, the substance, like many thermoplastics, is often technically classified as a type of glass (in that it is a non-crystalline vitreous substance) hence its occasional historical designation as acrylic glass. Chemically, it is the synthetic polymer of methyl methacrylate. The material was developed in 1928 in several different laboratories by many chemists, such as William Chalmers, Otto Röhm, and Walter Bauer, and was first brought to market in 1933 by German Röhm & Haas AG (as of January 2019 part of Evonik Industries) and its partner and former U.S. affiliate Rohm and Haas Company under the trademark Plexiglas. PMMA is an economical alternative to polycarbonate (PC) when tensile strength, flexural strength, transparency, polishability, and UV tolerance are more important than impact strength, chemical resistance, and heat resistance. Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful bisphenol-A subunits found in polycarbonate and is a far better choice for laser cutting. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when under load, especially under an impact force, and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA is sometimes able to achieve high scratch and impact resistance.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Chemical114806838|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Compound114818238|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ester114850483|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Insulator114821590|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/OrganicCompound114727670|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Polymer114994328|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCarboxylateEsters|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDentalMaterials|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDielectrics|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatOpticalMaterials|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatPolymers|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatTransparentMaterials|http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ChemicalCompound|http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ChemicalSubstance|http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Drug|http://umbel.org/umbel/rc/ChemicalSubstanceType|http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#ChemicalObject|http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing|http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11173

Typical fibril widths are 5–20 nanometers with a wide range of lengths, typically several micrometers. It is pseudo-plastic and exhibits thixotropy, the property of certain gels or fluids that are thick (viscous) under normal conditions, but become less viscous when shaken or agitated. When the shearing forces are removed the gel regains much of its original state. The fibrils are isolated from any cellulose containing source including wood-based fibers (pulp fibers) through high-pressure, high temperature and high velocity impact homogenization, grinding or microfluidization (see manufacture below). Nanocellulose can also be obtained from native fibers by an acid hydrolysis, giving rise to highly crystalline and rigid nanoparticles which are shorter (100s to 1000 nanometers) than the cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) obtained through homogenization, microfluiodization or grinding routes.

EEG is most often used to diagnose epilepsy, which causes abnormalities in EEG readings. It is also used to diagnose sleep disorders, depth of anesthesia, coma, encephalopathies, and brain death. EEG used to be a first-line method of diagnosis for tumors, stroke and other focal brain disorders, but this use has decreased with the advent of high-resolution anatomical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Despite limited spatial resolution, EEG continues to be a valuable tool for research and diagnosis. It is one of the few mobile techniques available and offers millisecond-range temporal resolution which is not possible with CT, PET or MRI. Derivatives of the EEG technique include evoked potentials (EP), which involves averaging the EEG activity time-locked to the presentation of a stimulus of some sort (visual, somatosensory, or auditory). Event-related potentials (ERPs) refer to averaged EEG responses that are time-locked to more complex processing of stimuli; this technique is used in cognitive science, cognitive psychology, and psychophysiological research.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Brain–computer_interfacing,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Application100949134|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Experiment105798043|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/HigherCognitiveProcess105770664|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Inquiry105797597|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Occupation100582388|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ProblemSolving105796750|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Process105701363|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Profession100609953|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Technology100949619|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thinking105770926|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Trial105799212|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Use100947128|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatEmergingTechnologies|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTests|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity|http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PersonFunction|http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

The idea behind the dynamic compression is that the femoral head component is allowed to move along one plane; since bone responds to dynamic stresses, the native femur may undergo primary healing: cells join along boundaries, resulting in a robust joint requiring no remodeling.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Orthopedic_screws,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CausalAgent100007347|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Defender109614684|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Keeper110229498|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Lawman110249459|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingThing100004258|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Organism100004475|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Person100007846|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Preserver110466918|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PrisonGuard110149867|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatOrthopedicScrews|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActor|http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo
