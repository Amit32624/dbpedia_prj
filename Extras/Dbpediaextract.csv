Medical gloves are made of different polymers including latex, nitrile rubber, polyvinyl chloride and neoprene; they come unpowdered, or powdered with corn starch to lubricate the gloves, making them easier to put on the hands. Corn starch replaced tissue-irritating lycopodium powder and talc, but even corn starch can impede healing if it gets into tissues (as during surgery). As such, unpowdered gloves are used more often during surgery and other sensitive procedures. Special manufacturing processes are used to compensate for the lack of powder. There are two main types of medical gloves: examination and surgical. Surgical gloves have more precise sizing with a better precision and sensitivity and are made to a higher standard. Examination gloves are available as either sterile or non-sterile, while surgical gloves are generally sterile. Besides medicine, medical gloves are widely used in chemical and biochemical laboratories. Medical gloves offer some basic protection against corrosives and surface contamination. However, they are easily penetrated by solvents and various hazardous chemicals, and should not be used for dishwashing or otherwise when the task involves immersion of the gloved hand in the solvent.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/BaseballEquipment102799897 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/BaseballGlove102800213 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Equipment103294048 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Implement103563967 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrument103574816 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MedicalInstrument103739693 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/SportsEquipment104285146 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/SurgicalInstrument104364545 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Tool104451818 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatGloves | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSurgicalInstruments | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatTools

The function of VADs is different from that of artificial cardiac pacemakers; some are for short-term use, typically for patients recovering from myocardial infarction (heart attack) and for patients recovering from cardiac surgery; some are for long-term use (months to years to perpetuity), typically for patients suffering from advanced heart failure. VADs are designed to assist either the right ventricle (RVAD) or the left ventricle (LVAD), or to assist both ventricles (BiVAD). The type of ventricular assistance device applied depends upon the type of underlying heart disease, and upon the pulmonary arterial resistance, which determines the workload of the right ventricle. The left ventricle assistance device (LVAD) is the most common device applied to a defective heart (it is sufficient in most cases; the right side of the heart is then often able to make use of the heavily increased blood flow), but when the pulmonary arterial resistance is high, then an (additional) right ventricle assistance device (RVAD) might be necessary to resolve the problem of cardiac circulation. If both a LVAD and a RVAD is needed a BiVAD is normally used, rather than a separate LVAD and an RVAD. Normally, the long-term VAD is used as a bridge to transplantation (BTT)—keeping the patient alive, and in reasonably good condition, and able to await the heart transplant outside of the hospital.Other ""bridges"" include bridge to candidacy, bridge to decision, and bridge to recovery.In some instances VADs are also used as destination therapy (DT). In this instance, the patient shall not undergo a heart transplantion and the VAD is what the patient will use for the remainder of their life.

The use of a sharp explorer to diagnose caries in pit and fissure sites is no longer recommended and clinicians instead should rely on ""sharp eyes and a blunt explorer or probe."" Penetration by a sharp explorer can actually cause cavitation in areas that are remineralizing or could be remineralized. Dental lesions initially develop as a subsurface lesion. Early lesions may be reversed - with meticulous patient self-care and application of fluoride - as long as the thin surface layer remains intact. The use of a dental explorer with firm pressure to probe suspicious areas may result in the rupture of the surface layer covering early lesions. Instead, they argue that fluoride and oral hygiene should be used to remineralize the enamel and prevent it from decaying further. This debate still continues because sometimes decay can be difficult to diagnose without tactile verification. Additionally, radiographs and other products designed to identify decay (such as measuring fluorescence from a laser) help the dental professional make a final diagnosis of tooth decay. There are various types of explorers, though the most common one is the No. 23 explorer, which is also known as a ""shepherd's hook"".

Debilitating pain from osteoarthritis is much more common in the elderly. Knee replacement surgery can be performed as a partial or a total knee replacement. In general, the surgery consists of replacing the diseased or damaged joint surfaces of the knee with metal and plastic components shaped to allow continued motion of the knee. The operation typically involves substantial postoperative pain, and includes vigorous physical rehabilitation. The recovery period may be 12 weeks or longer and may involve the use of mobility aids (e.g. walking frames, canes, crutches) to enable the patient's return to preoperative mobility.

Consequently, many surgeons apply adhesion barriers while performing abdominal and pelvic surgery. However, one study found the frequency of adhesion barrier use to be very low.

This procedure is frequently used to examine children's hearts for heart disease because there is no age or size requirement.,literal,en,"Doppler echocardiography is a procedure that uses Doppler ultrasonography to examine the heart. An echocardiogram uses high frequency sound waves to create an image of the heart while the use of Doppler technology allows determination of the speed and direction of blood flow by utilizing the Doppler effect. An echocardiogram can, within certain limits, produce accurate assessment of the direction of blood flow and the velocity of blood and cardiac tissue at any arbitrary point using the Doppler effect. One of the limitations is that the ultrasound beam should be as parallel to the blood flow as possible. Velocity measurements allow assessment of cardiac valve areas and function, any abnormal communications between the left and right side of the heart, any leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), calculation of the cardiac output and calculation of E/A ratio (a measure of diastolic dysfunction). Contrast-enhanced ultrasound-using gas-filled microbubble contrast media can be used to improve velocity or other flow-related medical measurements. An advantage of Doppler echocardiography is that it can be used to measure blood flow within the heart without invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterization. In addition, with slightly different filter/gain settings, the method can measure tissue velocities by tissue Doppler echocardiography. The combination of flow and tissue velocities can be used for estimating left ventricular filling pressure, although only under certain conditions. Although ""Doppler"" has become synonymous with ""velocity measurement"" in medical imaging, in many cases it is not the frequency shift (Doppler shift) of the received signal that is measured, but the phase shift (when the received signal arrives). However, the calculation result will end up identical.

Such joint replacement surgery generally is conducted to relieve arthritis pain or fix severe physical joint damage. Shoulder replacement surgery is an option for treatment of severe arthritis of the shoulder joint. Arthritis is a condition that affects the cartilage of the joints. As the cartilage lining wears away, the protective lining between the bones is lost. When this happens, painful bone-on-bone arthritis develops. Severe shoulder arthritis is quite painful, and can cause restriction of motion. While this may be tolerated with some medications and lifestyle adjustments, there may come a time when surgical treatment is necessary. There are a few major approaches to access the shoulder joint.

PET is mainly used in the area of medical imaging for detecting or measuring changes in physiological activities like metabolism, blood flow, regional chemical composition, and absorption, and therefore, also called a functional imaging technique. Since this PET technique uses radioactive materials (also known as a tracer or radio-tracer) for imaging, it is generally categorized within the field of nuclear medicine. A tracer is injected into the body, which gets trapped within the tissues of interest. The unstable nucleus of radio-ligand emit positrons, which combine with neighbouring electrons to produce gamma rays in the opposite direction at 180 degrees to each other. These gamma rays are detected by the ring of detector placed within the donut-shaped body of the scanner. The energy and location of these gamma rays are recorded and used by a computer program to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) images of tracer concentration within the body. In modern PET computed tomography scanners, PET images are often reconstructed with the aid of a computed tomography X-ray scan performed on the patient during the same session, in the same machine. Different tracers are used for various imaging purposes, depending on the target process within the body. For example, [18F]FDG is commonly used to detect cancer, [18F]NaF is widely used for detecting bone formation, and [15O]H2O is used to measure blood flow. One of the disadvantages of PET scanners is its operating cost. It can cost up to $8.2 million to set up a complete PET scan unit, and well over a million to obtain approximately 3000 scans per year, depending upon the local cost of living.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroimaging | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Positron_emission_tomography | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiation_therapy,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

EIM has been specifically recognized for its potential as an ALS biomarker (also known as a biological correlate or surrogate endpoint) by Prize4Life, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating the discovery of treatments and cures for ALS. The $1M ALS Biomarker Challenge focused on identifying a biomarker precise and reliable enough to cut Phase II drug trials in half. The prize was awarded to Dr. Seward Rutkove, chief, Division of Neuromuscular Disease, in the Department of Neurology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School, for his work in developing the technique of EIM and its specific application to ALS. It is hoped that EIM as a biomarker will result in the more rapid and efficient identification of new treatments for ALS. EIM has shown sensitivity to disease status in a variety of neuromuscular conditions, including radiculopathy, inflammatory myopathy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy. In addition to the assessment of neuromuscular disease, EIM also has the prospect of serving as a convenient and sensitive measure of muscle condition. Work in aging populations and individuals with orthopedic injuries indicates that EIM is very sensitive to muscle atrophy and disuse and is conversely likely sensitive to muscle conditioning and hypertrophy. Work on mouse and rats models, including a study of mice on board the final Space Shuttle mission (STS-135), has helped to confirm this potential value.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Measurement100996969 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatImpedanceMeasurements | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

It won a contract for reporting at Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust, Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in April 2018. As it employs radiologists in different time zones it can offer a 24-hour service cheaply.

Recently, Custodio et. al (2019) evaluated the potential involvement of dysregulated dopaminergic system, neuroadaption, and brain wave changes which may contribute to the rewarding and reinforcing properties of 25B-NBOMe in rodents. The carbon-11 labeled version of this compound ([11C]Cimbi-36) was synthesized and validated as a radioactive tracer for positron emission tomography (PET) in Copenhagen.

A leak can also be confirmed by the presence of beta-2 transferrin in fluid collected from the nose before this more invasive procedure is performed. The patient may be instructed to not eat or drink, or take medications such as aspirin or other blood thinners before the procedure. Pledgets can be inserted into the nasal cavity before the procedure when a CSF leak is suspected. The patient's spinal fluid is injected with a radiopharmaceutical tracer, such as DTPA tagged with indium 111, through a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). The tracer will diffuse up the spinal column and into the intracranial ventricles and the subarachnoid spaces around the brain. The progress of the tracer's diffusion through the CSF will be recorded by a nuclear medicine gamma camera. Images are usually taken immediately, at 6 hours, and at 24 hours. The patient may be asked to return for 48- and 72-hour follow-up scans. The pledgets will be removed and either imaged with a gamma camera or counted using a gamma counter. If the tracer has leaked onto the pledget through the skull, it will appear on the gamma camera image or register abnormal counts allowing the diagnostician to determine the location of the leak within the sinus cavity. The site of the CSF leak can be plugged with fat or muscle by endoscopic surgery. Headaches following the procedure are common, but should fade in 3–5 days.

The rise in calcium causes the cell's myofilaments to slide past each other in a process called excitation contraction coupling. Diseases of the heart muscle are of major importance.

Furthermore, the radiological community in Europe wanted to create a common platform for European radiologists. In 1985, a committee chaired by Prof. Dr. Josef Lissner from Munich (Germany) was established to re-organise the Congress. They decided that it should take place every two years and that the location should not change. Vienna was soon selected, due to its geographical location in the heart of Europe. The society ‘Verein Europäischer Röntgenkongress’ (ECR) was founded, and a congress-organising institution was established at the Medical Academy of Vienna. The first ‘new’ European Congress of Radiology was opened on Saturday, September 15, 1991 under the presidency of Prof. Dr. Lissner. It attracted more than 9,000 participants from around the world. The two-year cycle of the congress was continued until 1999, when it was decided that the rapid development of the medical specialty of radiology required an annual meeting of Europe's radiological community and all its partners. The ESR has continued to develop and refine its congress ever since, turning it into the largest radiological meeting in Europe with more than 28,000 participants from around 100 countries and 4,000 scientific papers and exhibits. To answer growing demand, the ECR has developed advanced tools such as EPOS, an online electronic presentation system and ECR Online, providing coverage of the majority of sessions via live video streaming.

Since 1994 it has become a biennial event. Until 1953 each congress was organised by radiological society of the host country, but in that year, a formal organisation, the International Society for Radiology was set up to provide continuity between the congresses. At the second congress, held in 1928 in Stockholm, three international commissions were set up - the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) and the International Commission on Radiological Education (ICRE). The latter two have become fully functional organisations in their own right while the latter has remained a sub-committee of the ICR. Within years of Röntgen discovering X-Rays in 1895, they were being used for imaging fractured bones. Various societies sprung up in different countries where ideas were exchanged between like-minded people and national standards for the measurement of X-Ray intensity developed. These societies also tried to address the problems associated with the dangers of X-Rays, particularly cancer. By the end of the First World War a number of proposals on how to measure the intensity of X-Rays had been made, but there was little agreement between the various parties concerned. In 1925 the British Institute of Radiology, under the leadership of Charles Thurstan Holland invited delegates from a number of countries to attend the First International Congress on Radiation in London. This congress set up a framework for future meetings - future congresses would meet every three years in a different country, would be organised by the host country. The host country would nominate the chairman of the congress. It was also established that three commissions should be set up which would meet at the congresses: 
* The International Commission of Radiation Units & Measures (ICRU) 
* The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) 
* The International Commission on Radiological Education (ICRE) Until the outbreak of the Second World War, congresses were held every three years. The 1940 congress was due to meet in Berlin in 1940, but was suspended due to the war. Apart from some copies of records kept by the 1973 Congress secretary-general, Benjamin Orndoff, the records of the congress, which had been handed to the German organisers in preparation for the next congress in Germany, were lost during the Second World War. The second congress was held in Stockholm under the chairmanship of Manne Siegbahn where the three commissions proposed in London met for the first time. Subsequent meetings were held in Paris (1931), Zurich (1934) and Chicago (1937). After the war, the British Institute of Radiology organised the sixth Congress which was held in London, exactly 25 years after the first congress and in the same hall as the first congress. A total of 3364 people from 54 countries including 1,742 radiologists registered for the congress. The incumbent chairman of the ICR, , who had been nominated thirteen years before was unable to attend the London conference, so Orndoff, the secretary-general of that congress deputised handing the presidency to . The congress also saw a resumption of the work of the three international commissions. At the seventh congress, held in Copenhagen in 1953, the organisational details of the conference were overhauled and an executive committee under the chairmanship of Lauriston S. Taylor was set up to oversee the organisation of future congresses and to provide continuity between congresses. Before the Second World War, the location of the congresses was dictated largely by the places of residence of the delegates who had to travel by rail or sea - a delegate from the western seaboard of the United States would have to commit a month to attend a week-long ICR congress in Europe. The advent of air travel removed this restriction and subsequent congresses have since been held in many parts of the world. The following congresses have been held to date (or are scheduled):",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiology_organizations,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Group100031264 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Organization108008335 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/SocialGroup107950920 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatInternationalHealthOrganizations | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatInternationalNon-profitOrganizations | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatInternationalNuclearEnergyOrganizations | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatOrganizationsEstablishedIn1925 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatOrganizationsEstablishedIn1928 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatRadiologyOrganizations | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatStandardsOrganizations | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActor | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

A head mirror is mostly used for examination of the ear, nose & throat. It comprises a circular concave mirror, with a small hole in the middle, and is attached to a head band. The mirror is worn over the physician's eye of choice, with the concave mirror surface facing outwards and the hole directly over the physician's eye, providing illumination like a ring light. In use, the patient sits and faces the physician. A bright lamp is positioned adjacent to the patient's head, pointing toward the physician's face and hence towards the head mirror. The light from the lamp reflects off the mirror, along the line of sight of the user, with the light being somewhat concentrated by the curvature of the mirror. When used properly, the head mirror thus provides excellent shadow-free illumination. Because they were once in common use, notably by general practitioners and otorhinolaryngologists, head mirrors are often a stereotypical part of a physician's uniform by costumers and prop men e.g. in comic routines. The main drawback to head mirrors was that they required some skill to use well. They are rarely seen outside of the ENT setting, having been largely replaced by pen lights among general practitioners. They are still routinely used by otolaryngologists, particularly for examinations and procedures involving the oral cavity.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_testing_equipment,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Mirror103773035 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Reflector104069276 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMirrors

Manual resuscitators are also used within the hospital for temporary ventilation of patients dependent on mechanical ventilators when the mechanical ventilator needs to be examined for possible malfunction or when ventilator-dependent patients are transported within the hospital. Two principal types of manual resuscitators exist; one version is self-filling with air, although additional oxygen (O2) can be added but is not necessary for the device to function. The other principal type of manual resuscitator (flow-inflation) is heavily used in non-emergency applications in the operating room to ventilate patients during anesthesia induction and recovery. Use of manual resuscitators to ventilate a patient is frequently called ""bagging"" the patient and is regularly necessary in medical emergencies when the patient's breathing is insufficient (respiratory failure) or has ceased completely (respiratory arrest). Use of the manual resuscitator force-feeds air or oxygen into the lungs in order to inflate them under pressure, thus constituting a means to manually provide positive-pressure ventilation.

However, the concomitant development of STORM, sharing the same fundamental principle, originally made use of paired cyanine dyes.One molecule of the pair (called activator), when excited near its absorption maximum, serves to reactivate the other molecule (called reporter) to the fluorescent state. A growing number of dyes are used for PALM, STORM and related techniques, both organic fluorophores and fluorescent proteins. Some are compatible with live cell imaging, others allow faster acquisition or denser labeling. The choice of a particular fluorophore ultimately depends on the application and on its underlying photophysical properties.

Echocardiography uses standard two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and Doppler ultrasound to create images of the heart. Echocardiography has become routinely used in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with any suspected or known heart diseases. It is one of the most widely used diagnostic tests in cardiology. It can provide a wealth of helpful information, including the size and shape of the heart (internal chamber size quantification), pumping capacity, and the location and extent of any tissue damage. An echocardiogram can also give physicians other estimates of heart function, such as a calculation of the cardiac output, ejection fraction, and diastolic function (how well the heart relaxes). Echocardiography is an important tool in assessing wall motion abnormality in patients with suspected cardiac disease. It is a tool which helps in reaching an early diagnosis of myocardial infarction showing regional wall motion abnormality of the heart. Also, it is important in treatment and followup in patients with heart failure, by assessing ejection fraction. Echocardiography can help detect cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and many others. The use of stress echocardiography may also help determine whether any chest pain or associated symptoms are related to heart disease. The biggest advantage to echocardiography is that it is not invasive (does not involve breaking the skin or entering body cavities) and has no known risks or side effects. Not only can an echocardiogram create ultrasound images of heart structures, but it can also produce accurate assessment of the blood flowing through the heart by Doppler echocardiography, using pulsed- or continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound. This allows assessment of both normal and abnormal blood flow through the heart. Color Doppler, as well as spectral Doppler, is used to visualize any abnormal communications between the left and right sides of the heart, any leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), and estimate how well the valves open (or do not open in the case of valvular stenosis). The Doppler technique can also be used for tissue motion and velocity measurement, by tissue Doppler echocardiography. Echocardiography was also the first ultrasound subspecialty to use intravenous contrast. Echocardiography is performed by cardiac sonographers, cardiac physiologists (UK), or physicians trained in echocardiography. Recognized as the “Father of Echocardiography”, the Swedish physician Inge Edler (1911-2001), a graduate of Lund University, was the first of his profession to apply ultrasonic pulse echo imaging in diagnosing cardiac disease, which the acoustical physicist Floyd Firestone had developed to detect defects in metal castings. In fact, Edler in 1953 produced the first echocardiographs using an industrial Firestone-Sperry Ultrasonic Reflectoscope. In developing echocardiography, Edler worked with the physicist Carl Hellmuth Hertz, the son of the Nobel laureate Gustav Hertz and grandnephew of Heinrich Rudolph Hertz.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cardiac_imaging | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_ultrasonography | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiology,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

It consists of a zirconium alloy metal substrate that transitions into a ceramic zirconium oxide outer surface. The ceramic surface is extremely abrasion resistant compared to traditional metal implant materials such as cobalt chromium. It also has a lower coefficient of friction against ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), the typical counterface material used in total joint replacements. These two factors likely contribute to the significantly lower UHMWPE wear rates observed in simulator testing. Reducing UHMWPE wear is thought to decrease the risk of implant failure due to osteolysis. All-ceramic materials can have a similar effect on reducing wear, but are brittle and difficult to manufacture. The metal substrate of Oxinium implants makes components easier to manufacture and gives them greater toughness (a combination of strength and ductility). In essence, this technology combines the abrasion resistance and low friction of a ceramic with the workability and toughness of a metal. This combination of properties led to Oxinium technology being the first ever implant-related technology to win the prestigious ASM International Engineering Materials Achievement Award (EMAA) in 2005. Current competitive reduced-wear options in total hip arthroplasty (THA) are ceramic-on-ceramic, metal-on-metal, and metal-on-cross-linked polyethylene. The only competitive reduced-wear option for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is metal-on-cross-linked polyethylene.

The magnitude of the receptor potential determines the frequency with which action potentials are generated, and is controlled by adaption, stimulus strength, and temporal summation of successive receptor potentials. Receptor potential relies on receptor sensitivity which can adapt slowly, resulting in a slowly decaying receptor potential or rapidly, resulting in a quickly generated but shorter lasting receptor potential. An example of a receptor potential is in a taste bud, where taste is converted into an electrical signal sent to the brain. When stimulated, the taste bud triggers the release of neurotransmitter through exocytosis of synaptic vesicles from the presynaptic membrane. The neurotransmitter molecules diffuse across the synaptic cleft to the postsynaptic membrane of the primary sensory neuron, where they elicit an action potential.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/BodyPart105220461 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part109385911 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Receptor105608868 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Structure105225602 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thing100002452 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatReceptors

Imaging techniques in X-ray, MRI, and ultrasound diagnostics yield a great deal of information that the radiologist or other medical professional has to analyze and evaluate comprehensively in a short time. CAD systems process digital images for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases, in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professional. CAD also has potential future applications in digital pathology with the advent of whole-slide imaging and machine learning algorithms. So far its application has been limited to quantifying immunostaining but is also being investigated for the standard H&E stain. CAD is an interdisciplinary technology combining elements of artificial intelligence and computer vision with radiological and pathology image processing. A typical application is the detection of a tumor. For instance, some hospitals use CAD to support preventive medical check-ups in mammography (diagnosis of breast cancer), the detection of polyps in the colon, and lung cancer. Computer-aided detection (CADe) systems are usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense structures in the soft tissue. This allows the radiologist to draw conclusions about the condition of the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., the size of a tumor or the tumor's behavior in contrast medium uptake. Computer-aided simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. negative and positive). CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required. Although CAD has been used in clinical environments for over 40 years, CAD usually does not substitute the doctor or other professional, but rather plays a supporting role. The professional (generally a radiologist) is generally responsible for the final interpretation of a medical image. However, the goal of some CAD systems is to detect earliest signs of abnormality in patients that human professionals cannot, as in , architectural distortion in mammograms, ground-glass nodules in thoracic CT, and non-polypoid (“flat”) lesions in CT colonography.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Experiment105798043 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/HigherCognitiveProcess105770664 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Inquiry105797597 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Occupation100582388 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ProblemSolving105796750 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Process105701363 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thinking105770926 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Trial105799212 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatHealthcareOccupations | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTests | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

RFA is generally conducted in the outpatient setting, using either local anesthetics or conscious sedation anesthesia. When it is delivered via catheter, it is called radiofrequency catheter ablation. Two important advantages of radio frequency current (over previously used low frequency AC or pulses of DC) are that it does not directly stimulate nerves or heart muscle and therefore can often be used without the need for general anesthesia, and that it is very specific for treating the desired tissue without significant collateral damage. Documented benefits have led to RFA becoming widely used during the 21st century. RFA procedures are performed under image guidance (such as X-ray screening, CT scan or ultrasound) by an interventional pain specialist (such as an anesthesiologist), interventional radiologist, otolaryngologists, a gastrointestinal or surgical endoscopist, or a cardiac electrophysiologist, a subspecialty of cardiologists.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Interventional_radiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatVascularProcedures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

The term radioisotope, which in its general sense refers to any radioactive isotope (radionuclide), has historically been used to refer to all radiopharmaceuticals, and this usage remains common. Technically, however, many radiopharmaceuticals incorporate a radioactive tracer atom into a larger pharmaceutically-active molecule, which is localized in the body, after which the radionuclide tracer atom allows it to be easily detected with a gamma camera or similar gamma imaging device. An example is fludeoxyglucose in which fluorine-18 is incorporated into deoxyglucose.

This causes reduction of sympathetic afferent and efferent activity to the kidney and blood pressure can be decreased. Early data from international clinical trials without sham controls was promising - demonstrating large blood pressure reductions in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. However, in 2014 a prospective, single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial failed to confirm a beneficial effect on blood pressure.

The goal of mammography is the early detection of breast cancer, typically through detection of characteristic masses or microcalcifications. As with all X-rays, mammograms use doses of ionizing radiation to create images. These images are then analyzed for abnormal findings. It is usual to employ lower-energy X-rays, typically Mo (K-shell x-ray energies of 17.5 and 19.6 keV) and Rh (20.2 and 22.7 keV) than those used for radiography of bones. Ultrasound, ductography, positron emission mammography (PEM), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are adjuncts to mammography. Ultrasound is typically used for further evaluation of masses found on mammography or palpable masses not seen on mammograms. Ductograms are still used in some institutions for evaluation of bloody nipple discharge when the mammogram is non-diagnostic. MRI can be useful for further evaluation of questionable findings, as well as for screening pre-surgical evaluation in patients with known breast cancer, in order to detect additional lesions that might change the surgical approach, for example, from breast-conserving lumpectomy to mastectomy. Other procedures being investigated include tomosynthesis. For the average woman, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends (2016) mammography every two years between the ages of 50 and 74, concluding that ""the benefit of screening mammography outweighs the harms by at least a moderate amount from age 50 to 74 years and is greatest for women in their 60s"". The American College of Radiology and American Cancer Society recommend yearly screening mammography starting at age 40. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (2012) and the European Cancer Observatory (2011) recommend mammography every 2 to 3 years between ages 50 and 69. These task force reports point out that in addition to unnecessary surgery and anxiety, the risks of more frequent mammograms include a small but significant increase in breast cancer induced by radiation. Additionally, mammograms should not be performed with increased frequency in patients undergoing breast surgery, including breast enlargement, mastopexy, and breast reduction. The Cochrane Collaboration (2013) concluded after ten years that trials with adequate randomization did not find an effect of mammography screening on total cancer mortality, including breast cancer. The authors of this Cochrane review write: ""If we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% and that overdiagnosis and over-treatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2,000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings."" The authors conclude that the time has come to re-assess whether universal mammography screening should be recommended for any age group. They state that universal screening may not be reasonable. The Nordic Cochrane Collection updated research in 2012 and stated that advances in diagnosis and treatment make mammography screening less effective today, rendering it “no longer effective.” They conclude that “it therefore no longer seems reasonable to attend” for breast cancer screening at any age, and warn of misleading information on the internet. On the contrary, a report in the New England Journal of Medicine attributes the poor effectiveness of national mammography screening programs at reducing breast cancer mortality to radiation-induced cancers. Mammography has a false-negative (missed cancer) rate of at least ten percent. This is partly due to dense tissue obscuring the cancer and the appearance of cancer on mammograms having a large overlap with the appearance of normal tissue. A meta-analysis review of programs in countries with organized screening found a 52% over-diagnosis rate.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Breast_imaging,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength. Titanium is resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine. Titanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth after the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of mineral deposits, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere; it is found in almost all living things, as well as bodies of water, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene. Titanium can be alloyed with iron, aluminium, vanadium, and molybdenum, among other elements, to produce strong, lightweight alloys for aerospace (jet engines, missiles, and spacecraft), military, industrial processes (chemicals and petrochemicals, desalination plants, pulp, and paper), automotive, agriculture (farming), medical prostheses, orthopedic implants, dental and endodontic instruments and files, dental implants, sporting goods, jewelry, mobile phones, and other applications. The two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio, the highest of any metallic element. In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but less dense. There are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element, 46Ti through 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8%). Although they have the same number of valence electrons and are in the same group in the periodic table, titanium and zirconium differ in many chemical and physical properties.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing

Vitallium was developed by Albert W. Merrick for the Austenal Laboratories in 1932. In 2016 Norman Sharp, a 91-year-old British man, was recognised as having the world's oldest hip replacement implants. The two Vitallium implants were implanted in November 1948 at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, under the newly formed NHS. The 67-year-old implants had such an unusually long life, partly because they had not required the typical replacement of such implants, but also because of Sharp's young age of 23 when they were implanted, owing to a childhood case of septic arthritis. For high-temperature use in engines, particularly turbochargers, the first alloy used was Haynes Stellite No. 21, similar to Vitallium. This was suggested by the British engineer, and denture wearer, S.D. Heron during World War II. Although the characteristics of the material obviously suggested itself for making turbocharger blades, it was thought impossible to cast it to the precision needed.

The required pressure for administrating the drug comes from the elastomeric layer that is molded inside the pump. When the pump is filled the layer is stretched. The elastic constriction drives the liquid through the tubing and eventually through a flow restrictor out into the patient connection. The pressure is consistent until near the end of the infusion, when there will usually be a pressure spike resulting in a higher flow rate. The accuracy of the flow rate is controlled by a flow restrictor (glass capillary or steel cannula) that is molded into the tubing of the system or placed within the elastomeric reservoir. Elastomeric pumps do not require any electricity and are not gravity driven. When placed above or below the patient, flow rate is typically increased or decreased slightly (head height effect). Filling the pump is done manually through a one-way valve using a syringe or peristaltic repeater pump.

There exists 2 different norms of the thread that are not compatible to each other. The US norm have a taper thread and is mostly used in the United States, Canada, Spain and South Korea. Indirect vision is needed in certain locations of the mouth where visibility is difficult or impossible. The posterior (or lingual) surfaces of the anterior maxillary teeth is a notable area where mouth mirrors are often used. Other areas of the mouth can be viewed more readily with the mouth mirror, even though it would be possible to see them if the dentist or dental hygienist adjusted their body into a poor position. Without the mouth mirror, poor body positioning would occur daily and lead to chronic postural problems, especially of the back and neck. There are other areas of the mouth where lighting is difficult, even with overhead dentists' lights. In these instances, the mouth mirror is used to reflect light onto those surfaces. This is especially useful if the mirror is simultaneously being used for indirect vision of an obscure area. Additionally, the mouth mirror is used to retract tissues, such as the tongue or cheeks, to gain better visualization of the teeth. Dentist's mirrors are also commonly used by engineers to allow vision in tight spaces and around corners in equipment.

Clear-aligner treatment involves an orthodontist or dentist, or with home-based systems, the person themselves, taking a mold of the patient's teeth, which is used to create a digital tooth scan.

MRI does not involve X-rays or the use of ionizing radiation, which distinguishes it from CT and PET scans. MRI is a medical application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). NMR can also be used for imaging in other NMR applications, such as NMR spectroscopy. While the hazards of ionizing radiation are now well controlled in most medical contexts, an MRI may still be seen as a better choice than a CT scan. MRI is widely used in hospitals and clinics for medical diagnosis and staging and follow-up of disease without exposing the body to radiation. An MRI may yield different information compared with CT. Risks and discomfort may be associated with MRI scans. Compared with CT scans, MRI scans typically take longer and are louder, and they usually need the subject to enter a narrow, confining tube. In addition, people with some medical implants or other non-removable metal inside the body may be unable to undergo an MRI examination safely. MRI was originally called NMRI (nuclear magnetic resonance imaging), but ""nuclear"" was dropped to avoid negative associations. Certain atomic nuclei are able to absorb radio frequency energy when placed in an external magnetic field; the resultant evolving spin polarization can induce an RF signal in a radio frequency coil and thereby be detected. In clinical and research MRI, hydrogen atoms are most often used to generate a macroscopic polarization that is detected by antennas close to the subject being examined. Hydrogen atoms are naturally abundant in humans and other biological organisms, particularly in water and fat. For this reason, most MRI scans essentially map the location of water and fat in the body. Pulses of radio waves excite the nuclear spin energy transition, and magnetic field gradients localize the polarization in space. By varying the parameters of the pulse sequence, different contrasts may be generated between tissues based on the relaxation properties of the hydrogen atoms therein. Since its development in the 1970s and 1980s, MRI has proven to be a versatile imaging technique. While MRI is most prominently used in diagnostic medicine and biomedical research, it also may be used to form images of non-living objects. MRI scans are capable of producing a variety of chemical and physical data, in addition to detailed spatial images. The sustained increase in demand for MRI within health systems has led to concerns about cost effectiveness and overdiagnosis.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Magnetic_resonance_imaging,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, including humans, they might also conceivably be any kind of organism. D. S.

In science fiction, the most recognizable portrayal of a cyborg is a human being with visibly mechanical parts, such as the superhero Cyborg from DC Comics or the Borg from Star Trek. But cyborgs may also be portrayed as looking more like robots or more like ordinary humans. Cyborgs may appear as humanoid robots, such as Robotman from DC's Doom Patrol or the Cybermen from Doctor Who, or they may appear as non-humanoid robots, such as the Daleks in Doctor Who or some of the Motorball players in Battle Angel Alita. More human appearing cyborgs may cover up their mechanical parts with armor or clothing, such as Darth Vader from Star Wars or Misty Knight from Marvel Comics. Cyborgs may even have mechanical parts or bodies that appear human. The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman had bionic parts that looked like the body parts they replaced. Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell is a full-body cyborg whose body looks human. In the examples mentioned, as well as many more, it is common for cyborgs to have physical or mental abilities beyond what humans are capable of.

In women with a prior spontaneous preterm birth and who are pregnant with one baby, and have shortening of the cervical length less than 25 mm, a cerclage prevents a preterm birth and reduces death and illness in the baby. The treatment consists of a strong suture sewn into and around the cervix early in the pregnancy, usually between weeks 12 to 14, and then removed towards the end of the pregnancy when the greatest risk of miscarriage has passed. The procedure is performed under local anaesthesia, usually by way of a spinal block. It is typically performed on an outpatient basis by an obstetrician-gynecologist. Usually the treatment is done in the first or second trimester of pregnancy, for a woman who has had one or more late miscarriages in the past. The word ""cerclage"" means ""hoop"" in French, as in the metal hoop encircling a barrel. There is no evidence that cerclage is effective in a multiple gestation pregnancy for preventing preterm births and reducing perinatal deaths or neonatal morbidity. The success rate for cervical cerclage is approximately 80-90% for elective cerclages, and 40-60% for emergency cerclages. A cerclage is considered successful if labor and delivery is delayed to at least 37 weeks (full term). After the cerclage has been placed, the patient will be observed for at least several hours (sometimes overnight) to ensure that she does not go into premature labor. The patient will then be allowed to return home, but will be instructed to remain in bed or avoid physical activity (including sexual intercourse) for two to three days, or up to two weeks. Follow-up appointments will usually take place so that her doctor can monitor the cervix and stitch and watch for signs of premature labor. For women who are pregnant with one baby (a singleton pregnancy) and at risk for a preterm birth, when cerclage is compared with no treatment, there is a reduction in preterm birth and there may be a reduction in the number of babies who die (perinatal mortality) There is no evidence that cerclage is effective in a multiple gestation pregnancy for preventing preterm births and reducing perinatal deaths or neonatal morbidity.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Content105809192 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Issue105814650 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatHealthIssuesInPregnancy | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

FIM can be considered a bridge between Four Electrode Impedance Measurement (FEIM) and Electrical impedance Tomography (EIT), and provides a middle ground in terms of simplicity and accuracy. Many biological parameters and processes can be detected and monitored through their effects on bioimpedance. Bioimpedance measurement can be performed with a few simple instruments and non-invasively. Measurement of electrical impedance to obtain physiological or diagnostic information has been of interest to researchers for many years. However, the human body is geometrically and conductively uneven, with variation between individuals and phases of normal body activity, and bioimpedance results from many factors, including ion concentrations, cell geometry, extra-cellular fluids, intra-cellular fluids, and organ geometry. This makes accurate analysis of results from a small number of electrodes difficult and unreliable. Identifying zones with specific impedances can provide greater certainty regarding the factors behind the impedance. Conventional Four Electrode or Tetra-polar Impedance Measurement (TPIM) is simple, but the zone of sensitivity is not well defined and may include organs other that those of interest, making interpretation difficult and unreliable. On the other hand, Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) offers reasonable resolution, but is complex and require many electrodes. By placing two FEIM systems perpendicular to each other over a common zone at the center and combining the results, it is possible to obtain enhanced sensitivity over this central zone. This is the basis of FIM, which may be useful for impedance measurements of large organs like stomach, heart, and lungs. Being much simpler in comparison to EIT, multifrequency systems can be simply built for FIM. FIM may be useful in other fields where impedance measurements are performed, like geology.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Experiment105798043 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/HigherCognitiveProcess105770664 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Inquiry105797597 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Measurement100996969 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ProblemSolving105796750 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Process105701363 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thinking105770926 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Trial105799212 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatImpedanceMeasurements | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTests | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

The name of the device is derived from the fact that the clitoral stimulator looks like a pair of rabbit ears. In the history of sex toys, rabbit vibrators appeared relatively recently, since the 1990s, in response to the growing female demand for more pleasurable sex toys; their popularity was boosted in the United States after an episode of HBO's Sex and the City (""The Turtle and the Hare"") featured Vibratex's Rabbit Pearl, making it a bestseller. Rabbit vibrators are designed to give more intense sensations than the more traditional dildo or clitoral stimulator, by providing simultaneous vaginal and clitoral stimulation.

The established technique is to dip the needle in the vaccine, and then puncture a person's upper arm fifteen times in a small circular area. When done correctly a trace of blood appears at the vaccination site. The bifurcated needle was created as a more efficient and cost effective alternative to the jet injector previously in use. It was invented in 1965 by Dr. Benjamin Rubin, working at Wyeth Laboratories, and was the primary instrument used during the World Health Organization's 1966–1977 campaign to eradicate smallpox. Rubin estimated that it was used to administer 200 million vaccinations per year during the final years of the campaign. After the September 11, 2001 attacks and subsequent anthrax scares, the US government ordered the smallpox vaccine be available for every person in the country. Precision Medical Products, Inc. was awarded the contract to make the bifurcated needles to go along with the vaccine and made over 400,000,000 of these needles in a two year span.

The four members of this family form voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that seem to be specific to sperm. As sperm encounter the more alkaline environment of the female reproductive tract, CatSper channels become activated by the altered ion concentration. These channels are required for proper fertilization. The study of these channels has been slow because they do not traffic to the cell membrane in many heterologous systems. There are several factors that can activate the CatSper calcium channel, depending on species. In the human, channel is activated by progesterone released by the oocyte. The human CatSper channel is pH-sensitive, and requires a high-pH environment.  CatSper plays a key role in mediating hyperactive motility – prior to fertilization, sperm become entrapped within the fingerlike projections of the microvilli of the oviduct. In order for the sperm to fertilize the oocyte, CatSper must be present in order to initiate hyperactive motility, allowing the sperm to escape the microvilli and reach the oocyte for fertilization. Of the four members of the Catsper family, Catsper1 is found in the primary piece of sperm. Catsper1 plays an important role in evoked Ca2+ entry and regulation of hyperactivation in sperm. Catsper2 is localized in the sperm tail and is responsible for regulation of hyperactivation. Catsper3 and Catsper4 are found in both, the testes and sperm and play an important role in the motility of hyperactivated sperm. Although Catsper seems to play an important role in sperm function, Catspers1-4 null mice have been found to have normal testicular histology, sperm counts and morphology, which is indicative of normal progression of spermatogenesis.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Channel106259898 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Chemical114806838 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Communication106252138 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Compound114818238 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Macromolecule114944888 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Molecule114682133 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/OrganicCompound114727670 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Protein114728724 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thing100002452 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Transmission106251781 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Unit109465459 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatIonChannels | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatProteins | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Biomolecule | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Protein | http://umbel.org/umbel/rc/ProteinMolecule | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q206229 | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8054

Relative contraindications include the presence of infected urine, pregnancy (because of radiation), or allergy to the contrast. Because a pyelogram involves cystoscopy, it may cause sepsis, infection or bleeding, and may also cause nausea and vomiting. The dye may also be toxic to the kidneys. Before the procedure, a person is usually asked to complete a safety check assessing for potential risks, such as pregnancy or allergy. They may be asked to take an enema, and not to eat for some hours. An intravenous drip is inserted and a person is given some sedation before a cystoscope, which is a flexible tube, is inserted into the bladder via the urethra.

The radiation types of greatest concern are thermal radiation, radio frequency energy, ultraviolet light and ionizing radiation. The most common type of radiation burn is a sunburn caused by UV radiation. High exposure to X-rays during diagnostic medical imaging or radiotherapy can also result in radiation burns. As the ionizing radiation interacts with cells within the body—damaging them—the body responds to this damage, typically resulting in erythema—that is, redness around the damaged area. Radiation burns are often discussed in the same context as radiation-induced cancer due to the ability of ionizing radiation to interact with and damage DNA, occasionally inducing a cell to become cancerous. Cavity magnetrons can be improperly used to create surface and internal burning. Depending on the photon energy, gamma radiation can cause very deep gamma burns, with 60Co internal burns common. Beta burns tend to be shallow as beta particles are not able to penetrate deeply into the person; these burns can be similar to sunburn. Alpha particles can cause internal alpha burns if inhaled, with external damage (if any) being limited to minor erythema. Radiation burns can also occur with high power radio transmitters at any frequency where the body absorbs radio frequency energy and converts it to heat. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) considers 50 watts to be the lowest power above which radio stations must evaluate emission safety. Frequencies considered especially dangerous occur where the human body can become resonant, at 35 MHz, 70 MHz, 80-100 MHz, 400 MHz, and 1 GHz.

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has established a programme on radiological protection of patients in recognition of the increasing importance of this topic. The emphasis in the past had been on radiation protection of staff and this emphasis has helped to reduce radiation doses to staff to levels much below the dose limits prescribed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and accepted by most countries.

This enhanced contrast allows lesions to be more easily identified. Mangafodipir was withdrawn from the US market in 2003 and the European market in 2012. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) participate in pathological tissue damage. Mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) normally keeps ROS and RNS in check. During development of mangafodipir as an MRI contrast agent, it was discovered that it possessed MnSOD mimetic activity. Mangafodipir has been tested as a chemotherapy adjunct in cancer patients and as an adjunct to percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with myocardial infarctions, with promising results. Whereas MRI contrast depends on release of Mn2+, the MnSOD mimetic activity depends on Mn2+ that remains bound to DPDP.  [Ca4Mn(DPDP)5] (brand name PledOx) is stabilized with respect to Mn2+ and has improved therapeutic activity.

Large amounts may result in fluid overload, swelling, acidosis, and high blood sodium. In those with long-standing low blood sodium, excessive use may result in osmotic demyelination syndrome. Saline is in the crystalloid family of medications. It is most commonly used as a sterile 9 g of salt per litre (0.9%) solution, known as normal saline. Higher and lower concentrations may also occasionally be used. Saline has a pH of 5.5 (mainly due to dissolved carbon dioxide) making it acidic. The medical use of saline began around 1831. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$0.60–4.20 per liter of normal saline. In 2017, sodium was the 225th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Intravenous_fluids,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Care100654885 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Fluid114939900 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Treatment100658082 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatIntravenousFluids | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTreatments | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Work100575741 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ChemicalSubstance | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Drug | http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#ChemicalObject | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8386

Historically, the preferred material for surgical scalpels was silver. Scalpel blades are also offered by some manufacturers with a zirconium nitride–coated edge to improve sharpness and edge retention.

The ICD is the first-line treatment and prophylactic therapy for patients at risk for sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Current devices can be programmed to detect abnormal heart rhythms and deliver therapy via programmable antitachycardia pacing in addition to low-energy and high-energy shocks. ""AICD"" was trademarked by the Boston Scientific corporation, so the more generic ""ICD"" is preferred terminology. Current device batteries last about 6–10 years, With advances in the technology (batteries with more capacity or, potentially in the future with rechargeable batteries) it may be possible to increase this well past 10 years. The lead (the electrical cable connecting the device to the heart) has a much longer average longevity but can incur various types of malfunction, specifically insulation failure or fracture of the conductor and require replacement. The process of implantation of an ICD system is similar to implantation of a pacemaker. In fact, ICDs are composed of an ICD generator and of wires. The first component or generator, contains a computer chip or circuitry with RAM (memory), programmable software, a capacitor and a battery; this is implanted typically under the skin in the left upper chest. The second part of the system is an electrode wire or wires that, similar to pacemakers, are connected to the generator and passed through a vein to the right chambers of the heart. The lead usually lodges in the apex or septum of the right ventricle. Just like pacemakers, ICDs can have a single wire or lead in the heart (in the right ventricle, single chamber ICD), two leads (in the right atrium and right ventricle, dual chamber ICD) or three leads (biventricular ICD, one in the right atrium, one in the right ventricle and one on the outer wall of the left ventricle). The difference between pacemakers and ICDs is that pacemakers are also available as temporary units and are generally designed to correct slow heart rates, i.e. bradycardia, while ICDs are often permanent safeguards against sudden life-threatening arrhythmias. Recent developments include the subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD), and the ability to pace the left ventricle from multiple sites near-simultaneously with Multipoint Pacing (Abbott).",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cardiac_electrophysiology | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine) | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_devices | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroprosthetics,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Care100654885 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Crisis107417644 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Emergency107417405 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Happening107283608 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Juncture107416714 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Treatment100658082 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCardiacProcedures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalEmergencies | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTreatments | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Work100575741 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

In the United States it wasn't until the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) in 1938 that medical devices were regulated. Later in 1976, the Medical Device Amendments to the FD&C Act established medical device regulation and oversight as we know it today in the United States. Medical device regulation in Europe as we know it today came into effect in the 1993 by what is collectively known as the Medical Device Directive (MDD). On May 26, 2017 the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) replaced the MDD. Medical devices vary in both their intended use and indications for use. Examples range from simple, low-risk devices such as tongue depressors, medical thermometers, disposable gloves, and bedpans to complex, high-risk devices that are implanted and sustain life. One example of high-risk devices are those with Embedded software such as pacemakers, and which assist in the conduct of medical testing, implants, and prostheses. Items as intricate as housings for cochlear implants are manufactured through the deep drawn and shallow drawn manufacturing processes. The design of medical devices constitutes a major segment of the field of biomedical engineering. The global medical device market reached roughly US$209 billion in 2006 and was estimated to be between $220 and US$250 billion in 2013. The United States controls ~40% of the global market followed by Europe (25%), Japan (15%), and the rest of the world (20%). Although collectively Europe has a larger share, Japan has the second largest country market share. The largest market shares in Europe (in order of market share size) belong to Germany, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom. The rest of the world comprises regions like (in no particular order) Australia, Canada, China, India, and Iran. This article discusses what constitutes a medical device in these different regions and throughout the article these regions will be discussed in order of their global market share.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalDevices

The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) recommends that pregnant women have routine obstetric ultrasounds between 18 weeks' and 22 weeks' gestational age (the anatomy scan) in order to confirm pregnancy dating, to measure the fetus so that growth abnormalities can be recognized quickly later in pregnancy, and to assess for congenital malformations and multiple pregnancies (twins, etc). Additionally, the ISUOG recommends that pregnant patients who desire genetic testing have obstetric ultrasounds between 11 weeks' and 13 weeks 6 days' gestational age in countries with resources to perform them (the nuchal scan). Performing an ultrasound at this early stage of pregnancy can more accurately confirm the timing of the pregnancy, and can also assess for multiple fetuses and major congenital abnormalities at an earlier stage. Research shows that routine obstetric ultrasound before 24 weeks' gestational age can significantly reduce the risk of failing to recognize multiple gestations and can improve pregnancy dating to reduce the risk of labor induction for post-dates pregnancy.

Action potentials occur in several types of animal cells, called excitable cells, which include neurons, muscle cells, endocrine cells, glomus cells, and in some plant cells. In neurons, action potentials play a central role in cell-to-cell communication by providing for—or with regard to saltatory conduction, assisting—the propagation of signals along the neuron's axon toward synaptic boutons situated at the ends of an axon; these signals can then connect with other neurons at synapses, or to motor cells or glands. In other types of cells, their main function is to activate intracellular processes. In muscle cells, for example, an action potential is the first step in the chain of events leading to contraction. In beta cells of the pancreas, they provoke release of insulin. Action potentials in neurons are also known as ""nerve impulses"" or ""spikes"", and the temporal sequence of action potentials generated by a neuron is called its ""spike train"". A neuron that emits an action potential, or nerve impulse, is often said to ""fire"". Action potentials are generated by special types of voltage-gated ion channels embedded in a cell's plasma membrane. These channels are shut when the membrane potential is near the (negative) resting potential of the cell, but they rapidly begin to open if the membrane potential increases to a precisely defined threshold voltage, depolarising the transmembrane potential. When the channels open, they allow an inward flow of sodium ions, which changes the electrochemical gradient, which in turn produces a further rise in the membrane potential. This then causes more channels to open, producing a greater electric current across the cell membrane and so on. The process proceeds explosively until all of the available ion channels are open, resulting in a large upswing in the membrane potential. The rapid influx of sodium ions causes the polarity of the plasma membrane to reverse, and the ion channels then rapidly inactivate. As the sodium channels close, sodium ions can no longer enter the neuron, and they are then actively transported back out of the plasma membrane. Potassium channels are then activated, and there is an outward current of potassium ions, returning the electrochemical gradient to the resting state. After an action potential has occurred, there is a transient negative shift, called the afterhyperpolarization. In animal cells, there are two primary types of action potentials. One type is generated by voltage-gated sodium channels, the other by voltage-gated calcium channels. Sodium-based action potentials usually last for under one millisecond, but calcium-based action potentials may last for 100 milliseconds or longer. In some types of neurons, slow calcium spikes provide the driving force for a long burst of rapidly emitted sodium spikes. In cardiac muscle cells, on the other hand, an initial fast sodium spike provides a ""primer"" to provoke the rapid onset of a calcium spike, which then produces muscle contraction.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Prolific inventors in thin film drug delivery include Richard Fuisz, Joseph Fuisz, Garry Myers and Robert Yang. This group has contributed over thirty patents in this field. Thin-film drug delivery has emerged as an advanced alternative to the traditional tablets, capsules and liquids often associated with prescription and OTC medications. Similar in size, shape and thickness to a postage stamp, thin-film strips are typically designed for oral administration, with the user placing the strip on or under the tongue (sublingual) or along the inside of the cheek (buccal). These drug delivery options allow the medication to bypass the first pass metabolism thereby making the medication more bioavailable. As the strip dissolves, the drug can enter the blood stream enterically, buccally or sublingually. Evaluating the systemic transmucosal drug delivery, the buccal mucosa is the preferred region as compared to the sublingual mucosa. Different buccal delivery products have been marketed or are proposed for certain diseases like trigeminal neuralgia, Meniere's disease, diabetes, and addiction. There are many commercial non-drug product to use thin films like Mr. Mint and Listerine PocketPaks breath freshening strips. Since then, thin-film products for other breath fresheners, as well as a number of cold, flu, anti-snoring and gastrointestinal medications, have entered the marketplace. There are currently several projects in development that will deliver prescription drugs using the thin-film dosage form. Formulation of oral drug strips involves the application of both aesthetic and performance characteristics such as strip-forming polymers, plasticizers, active pharmaceutical ingredient, sweetening agents, saliva stimulating agent, flavoring agents, coloring agents, stabilizing and thickening agents. From the regulatory perspectives, all excipients used in the formulation of oral drug strips should be approved for use in oral pharmaceutical dosage forms.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Creation103129123 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Movie106613686 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Product104007894 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Show106619065 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/SocialEvent107288639 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDrugDeliveryDevices | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatThinFilms | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

When a presynaptic neuron is excited, it releases a neurotransmitter from vesicles into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter then binds to receptors located on the postsynaptic neuron. If these receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, a resulting conformational change opens the ion channels, which leads to a flow of ions across the cell membrane. This, in turn, results in either a depolarization, for an excitatory receptor response, or a hyperpolarization, for an inhibitory response. These receptor proteins are typically composed of at least two different domains: a transmembrane domain which includes the ion pore, and an extracellular domain which includes the ligand binding location (an allosteric binding site). This modularity has enabled a 'divide and conquer' approach to finding the structure of the proteins (crystallising each domain separately). The function of such receptors located at synapses is to convert the chemical signal of presynaptically released neurotransmitter directly and very quickly into a postsynaptic electrical signal. Many LICs are additionally modulated by allosteric ligands, by channel blockers, ions, or the membrane potential. LICs are classified into three superfamilies which lack evolutionary relationship: cys-loop receptors, ionotropic glutamate receptors and ATP-gated channels.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Channel106259898 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Chemical114806838 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Communication106252138 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Compound114818238 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Macromolecule114944888 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Molecule114682133 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/OrganicCompound114727670 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Protein114728724 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thing100002452 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Transmission106251781 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Unit109465459 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatIonChannels | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatProteins | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Biomolecule | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Protein | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q206229 | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8054

This technique relies on the fact that cerebral blood flow and neuronal activation are coupled. When an area of the brain is in use, blood flow to that region also increases. The primary form of fMRI uses the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrast, discovered by Seiji Ogawa in 1990. This is a type of specialized brain and body scan used to map neural activity in the brain or spinal cord of humans or other animals by imaging the change in blood flow (hemodynamic response) related to energy use by brain cells. Since the early 1990s, fMRI has come to dominate brain mapping research because it does not require people to undergo injections or surgery, to ingest substances, or to be exposed to ionizing radiation. This measure is frequently corrupted by noise from various sources; hence, statistical procedures are used to extract the underlying signal. The resulting brain activation can be graphically represented by color-coding the strength of activation across the brain or the specific region studied. The technique can localize activity to within millimeters but, using standard techniques, no better than within a window of a few seconds. Other methods of obtaining contrast are arterial spin labeling and diffusion MRI. The latter procedure is similar to BOLD fMRI but provides contrast based on the magnitude of diffusion of water molecules in the brain. In addition to detecting BOLD responses from activity due to tasks/stimuli, fMRI can measure resting state fMRI, or taskless fMRI, which shows the subjects' baseline BOLD variance. Since about 1998 studies have shown the existence and properties of the default mode network (DMN), aka 'Resting State Network' (RSN), a functionally connected neural network of apparent 'brain states'. fMRI is used in research, and to a lesser extent, in clinical work. It can complement other measures of brain physiology such as EEG and NIRS. Newer methods which improve both spatial and time resolution are being researched, and these largely use biomarkers other than the BOLD signal. Some companies have developed commercial products such as lie detectors based on fMRI techniques, but the research is not believed to be developed enough for widespread commercialization.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Magnetic_resonance_imaging | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroimaging,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/MusicGenre | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Freely moving animals may turn through several revolutions in one direction. While recording from freely moving animals, therefore, an electrical commutator is needed to prevent twisting of the wires that go from the electrode (moving and rotating with the head) to the amplifier/recorder (fixed to the ground). Traditional electrical commutators use slip rings for coupling. Slip rings however inject  into the connection. This is because as the contact points slide over the surface of the slip-rings they make microscopic bumps. The resultant variation in resistance and inductance causes electrical noise in the circuit. To reduce the electrical noise the contact points need to be pressed against the slip rings with greater force. This leads to great resistance and a higher rate of wear. Replacing the slip rings with pools of mercury — a conducting fluid — reduces commutator noise and friction, enabling commutator use for small weaker animals. OEM machinery manufacturers are discovering the benefits of using a mercury swivel commutator in their designs. For example packaging machines use some type of commutator or slip ring as a connection to the moving parts that are heated to seal the packages closed after they are filled. It is critical that the temperature sensing circuit be reliable and accurate. Unfortunately, using a slip ring assembly or standard electrical slip ring may cause problems due to electrical noise and degradation of signal produced by the rubbing contacts of the slip rings. Many OEM machinery manufacturers have switched to using mercury swivel commutators for reliable and accurate temperature control. It is also desirable to pass the power and the temperature signal through the same rotating electrical connector in order to minimize the number of connector parts that must be built into the machine. Multiple channel mercury swivel commutators are used for this purpose.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Connection103091374 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatElectricalConnectors

This act includes language related to the establishment of a Unique Device Identification System. When implemented, the new system will require: 
* The label of a device to bear a unique identifier, unless an alternative location is specified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or unless an exception is made for a particular device or group of devices. 
* The unique identifier to be able to identify the device through distribution and use 
* The unique identifier to include the lot or serial number if specified by FDA A national UDI system will create a common vocabulary for reporting and enhance electronic tracking abilities. Currently, analysis of adverse event reports is limited by the fact that the specific devices involved in an incident are often not known with the required degree of specificity. Without a common vocabulary for medical devices, meaningful analysis based on data from existing voluntary systems is problematic. Reliable and consistent identification of medical devices would enable safety surveillance so that the FDA and manufacturers could better identify potential problems or device defects, and improve patient care. The UDI is expected to improve patient safety (in part by helping to identify counterfeit products and by improving the ability of staff to distinguish between devices that are similar in appearance but serve different functions), facilitate and improve the recall process, and create efficiences within the medical system. In the most basic format, the UDI would be a coded number registered with standards organizations, and would incorporate a variety of information, including (but not limited to) the manufacturer of the device, expiry dates, the make and model of the device, and any special attributes that the device may possess. In a medical sense, ""device"" refers to any product that is not pharmaceutical in nature, and while the FDA have been given approval to exempt some devices, Jay Crowely (who was responsible for implementing the UDI requirements in the Act), has expressed an intent to apply the UDI to ""everything until somebody gives us good reason not to"", (excluding devices which won't need identification). Following the passing of the Act, there were calls for the FDA to publish a timeline for the implementation of the UDI; this was subsequently done. GUDID SubmissionThe Final Rule on Unique Device Identifiers also mandates medical device manufacturers to make a submission to the FDA's Global Unique Device Identification Database. The submission to the GUDID will include the Primary Device Identifier portion of the UDI as well as associated data attributes about each model or version number of the device. Compliance with the submission component of UDI compliance is phased according to the Class of device. Class III device labelers must submit to the GUDID for all existing products by September 24, 2014. Labelers of Implantable, Life Supporting or Life Sustaining devices must submit to the GUDID by September 24, 2015. Class II labelers must comply with submission guidelines by September 24, 2016, and Class I labelers by September 24, 2018. Submission to the GUDID may be made in one of two methods. The first method utilizes the FDA's GUDID Web Interface, which is meant for low volumes of GUDID submissions. The second method utilizes an HL7 SPL submission and is transmitted to the FDA through an Electronic Submission Gateway account. Once the initial submission is made, labelers of medical devices must update the GUDID submission each time there is a change to the device attributes. While many device attributes may be updated once the device record is published within the GUDID, several attributes cannot be changed and will necessitate the labeler deactivate the existing submission and resubmit using a new Device Identifier.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Regulation_of_medical_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Communication100033020 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Identifier107270601 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Signal106791372 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Symbol106806469 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatIdentifiers

At a certain moment this process becomes regenerative (vicious cycle) and results in the rapid ascending phase of action potential. In parallel with the depolarisation and sodium channel activation, the inactivation process of the sodium channels is also driven by depolarisation. Since the inactivation is much slower than the activation process, during the regenerative phase of action potential, inactivation is unable to prevent the ""chain reaction""-like rapid increase in the membrane voltage. During neuronal accommodation, the slowly rising depolarisation drives the activation and inactivation, as well as the potassium gates simultaneously and never evokes action potential. Failure to evoke action potential by ramp depolarisation of any strength had been a great puzzle until Hodgkin and Huxley created their physical model of action potential. Later in their life they received a Nobel Prize for their influential discoveries. Neuronal accommodation can be explained in two ways. ""First, during the passage of a constant cathodal current through the membrane, the potassium conductance and the degree of inactivation will rise, both factors raising the threshold. Secondly, the steady state ionic current at all strengths of depolarization is outward, so that an applied cathodal current which rises sufficiently slowly will never evoke a regenerative response from the membrane, and excitation will not occur.""

Actual applications of Self-microemulsifying drug delivery system' (SMEDDS) remain rare. The first drug marketed as a SMEDDS was cyclosporin, and it had significantly improved bioavailability compared with the conventional solution. In the last decade, several SMEDDS loaded with antiviral drugs (ritonavir, saquinavir) were tested for treatment of HIV infection, but the relative improvement in clinical benefit was not significant. The SMEDDS formulation of ritonavir (soft capsules) has been withdrawn in some countries. Within the last years SMEDDS were also utilized for the oral administration of biologics. Due to ion pairing with appropriate surfactants  these mainly hydrophilic macromolecular drugs can be incorporated in the lipophilic phase of SMEDDS. Provided that the oily droplets being formed in the gut are sufficiently stable towards lipases, can permeate the mucus gel layer in sufficient quantities  and exhibit permeation enhancing properties  the oral bioavailability of various biologics can be strongly improved SMEDDS offer numerous advantages: spontaneous formation, ease of manufacture, thermodynamic stability, and improved solubilization of bioactive materials. Improved solubility contributes to faster release rates and greater bioavailability. For many drugs taken by mouth, faster release rates improve the drug acceptance by consumers. Greater bioavailability means that less drug need be used; this may lower cost, and does lower the stomach irritation and toxicity of drugs taken by mouth. For oral use, SMEDDS may be formulated as liquids or solids, the solids packaged in capsules or tablets. Limited studies comparing these report that in terms of bioavailability liquid SMEDDS are superior to solid SMEDDS, which are superior to conventional tablets. Liquid SMEDDS have also shown value in injectable (IV and urethral) formulations and in a topical (oral) spray.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDrugDeliveryDevices

Modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) make use of this effect. The NMR signal observed following an initial excitation pulse decays with time due to both spin relaxation and any inhomogeneous effects which cause different spins in the sample to precess at different rates. The first of these, relaxation, leads to an irreversible loss of magnetisation. However, the inhomogeneous dephasing can be removed by applying a 180° inversion pulse that inverts the magnetisation vectors. Examples of inhomogeneous effects include a magnetic field gradient and a distribution of chemical shifts. If the inversion pulse is applied after a period t of dephasing, the inhomogeneous evolution will rephase to form an echo at time 2t. In simple cases, the intensity of the echo relative to the initial signal is given by e–2t/T2 where T2 is the time constant for spin-spin relaxation. The echo time (TE) is the time between the excitation pulse and the peak of the signal. Echo phenomena are important features of coherent spectroscopy which have been used in fields other than magnetic resonance including laser spectroscopy and neutron scattering. Echoes were first detected in nuclear magnetic resonance by Erwin Hahn in 1950, and spin echoes are sometimes referred to as Hahn echoes. In nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging, radiofrequency radiation is most commonly used. In 1972  introduced spin echo neutron scattering, a technique that can be used to study magnons and phonons in single crystals.

The subspecialty of oncology concerned with radiotherapy is called radiation oncology.",literal,en,"Radiation therapy or radiotherapy, often abbreviated RT, RTx, or XRT, is a therapy using ionizing radiation, generally as part of cancer treatment to control or kill malignant cells and normally delivered by a linear accelerator. Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part of adjuvant therapy, to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotherapy, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers. The subspecialty of oncology concerned with radiotherapy is called radiation oncology. Radiation therapy is commonly applied to the cancerous tumor because of its ability to control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging the DNA of cancerous tissue leading to cellular death. To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger absorbed dose there than in the surrounding healthy tissue. Besides the tumour itself, the radiation fields may also include the draining lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with the tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of subclinical malignant spread. It is necessary to include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor to allow for uncertainties in daily set-up and internal tumor motion. These uncertainties can be caused by internal movement (for example, respiration and bladder filling) and movement of external skin marks relative to the tumor position. Radiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation, and is distinct from radiology, the use of radiation in medical imaging and diagnosis. Radiation may be prescribed by a radiation oncologist with intent to cure (""curative"") or for adjuvant therapy. It may also be used as palliative treatment (where cure is not possible and the aim is for local disease control or symptomatic relief) or as therapeutic treatment (where the therapy has survival benefit and can be curative). It is also common to combine radiation therapy with surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy or some mixture of the four. Most common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way. The precise treatment intent (curative, adjuvant, neoadjuvant therapeutic, or palliative) will depend on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant. Brachytherapy, in which a radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, acoustic neuromas, severe thyroid eye disease, pterygium, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and prevention of keloid scar growth, vascular restenosis, and heterotopic ossification. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiation_therapy,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

By contrast, therapeutic IR procedures provide direct treatment—they include catheter-based medicine delivery, medical device placement (e.g., stents), and angioplasty of narrowed structures. The main benefits of interventional radiology techniques are that they can reach the deep structures of the body through a body orifice or tiny incision using small needles and wires. That decreases risks, pain, and recovery compared to open procedures. Real-time visualization also allows precision guidance to the abnormality, making the procedure or diagnosis more accurate. These benefits are weighed against the additional risks of lack of immediate access to internal structures (should bleeding or a perforation occur), and the risks of radiation exposure such as cataracts and cancer.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Interventional_radiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Content105809192 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Discipline105996646 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/KnowledgeDomain105999266 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LifeScience106037298 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MedicalScience106045562 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Medicine106043075 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/NaturalScience106000400 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Occupation100582388 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Science105999797 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalSpecialties | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

Both agents are administered by lumbar puncture (also referred to as a spinal tap or cisternal puncture), at the cervicocranial junction. The human patient is rolled from the lateral decubitus (lying on the side) to prone. Ankles are strapped to the end of a hard X-ray, CT, or MRI table. To obtain images of the cervical region the patient is then carefully tilted in the Trendelenberg position (head down) so the contrast agent (particularly Pantopaque) can enter the neck region. Care is given to prevent spilling dye into the posterior cranial fossa (back of the head) or to enter the cranial cavity in general. This speaks to the inability to remove the heavier or more viscous Pantopaque without aspirating it with spinal fluid (CSF) through a lumbar puncture needle in the low back (sticking up vertically) or back of the neck. Removal of Pantopauqe is necessary since it is non water-soluble. With metrizamide the issue is that if entering the cranial cavity and high dose exposure to the blood brain barrier, side effects are more likely encountered.

It was introduced into medical use by surgeon Heinrich Braun. Prior to the discovery of amylocaine and procaine, cocaine was a commonly used local anesthetic.

Another notable observation is the strong propensity of RTI-55 to cause locomotor activity enhancements, although in an earlier study, RTI-51 was actually even stronger than RTI-55 in shifting baseline LMA. This observation serves to highlight the disparities that can arise between studies. RTI-55 is one of the most potent phenyltropane stimulants commercially available, which limits its use in humans, as it might have significant abuse potential if used outside a strictly controlled medical setting. However, it is definitely worthy of mentioning that increasing the size of the halogen atom attached to troparil serves to reduce the number of lever responses in a session when these analogs were compared in a study. Although RTI-55 wasn't specifically examined in this study the number of lever responses in a given session was of the order cocaine > WIN35428 > RTI-31 > RTI-51. In contrast to RTI-31 which is predominantly dopaminergic, increasing the size of the covalently bonded halogen from a chlorine to an iodine markedly increases the affinity for the SERT, while retaining mostly all of its DAT blocking activity. The radiopharmaceutical forms of RTI-55, in which the iodine atom is radioiodine so that the drug can be used in single-photon emission computed tomography, are called iometopane I 123 (USAN) or iometopane 123I (INN) and iometopane I 125 (USAN) or iometopane 125I (INN).

Current research in molecular imaging involves cellular/molecular biology, chemistry, and medical physics, and is focused on: 1) developing imaging methods to detect previously undetectable types of molecules, 2) expanding the number and types of contrast agents available, and 3) developing functional contrast agents that provide information about the various activities that cells and tissues perform in both health and disease.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_imaging | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Molecular_imaging,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/AcademicDegree106697331 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Award106696483 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Communication100033020 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Master'sDegree106700447 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Signal106791372 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Symbol106806469 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMaster'sDegrees | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

In non-valvular AF, over 90% of stroke-causing clots that come from the heart are formed in the left atrial appendage. The most common treatment for AF stroke risk is treatment with blood-thinning medications, also called oral anticoagulants, which reduce the chance for blood clots to form. These medications (which include warfarin, and other newer approved blood thinners) are very effective in lowering the risk of stroke in AF patients. Most patients can safely take these medications for years (and even decades) without serious side effects. However, some patients find that blood thinning medications can be difficult to tolerate or are risky. Because they prevent blood clots by thinning the blood, blood thinners can increase the risk of bleeding problems. In select patients, physicians determine that an alternative to blood thinners is needed to reduce AF stroke risk. Approximately 45% of patients who are eligible for warfarin are not being treated, due to tolerance or adherence issues. This applies particularly to the elderly, although studies have indicated that they can also benefit from anticoagulants. Left atrial appendage closure is an implant-based alternative to blood thinners. Like blood thinning medications, an LAAC implant does not cure AF. A stroke can be due to factors not related to a clot traveling to the brain from the left atrium. Other causes of stroke can include high blood pressure and narrowing of the blood vessels to the brain. An LAAC implant will not prevent these other causes of stroke.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

David Sheridan was the inventor of the modern ""disposable"" plastic endotracheal tube now used routinely in surgery. Previous to his invention, red rubber tubes were used, then sterilized, and re-used which often lead to the spread of disease and also a high risk of infection. Sheridan is thus credited with saving thousands of lives. He held more than 50 medical instrument patents and is credited with inventing the modern disposable catheter in the 1940s. In his lifetime he started and sold four catheter companies and was dubbed the ""Catheter King"" by Forbes magazine in 1988.

The practice of examining pregnant women using ultrasound is called obstetric ultrasound, and was an early development and application of clinical ultrasonography. Ultrasound are sound waves with frequencies which are higher than those audible to humans (>20,000 Hz). Ultrasonic images, also known as sonograms, are made by sending pulses of ultrasound into tissue using a probe. The ultrasound pulses echo off tissues with different reflection properties and are recorded and displayed as an image. Many different types of images can be formed. The most common is a B-mode image (Brightness), which displays the acoustic impedance of a two-dimensional cross-section of tissue. Other types can display blood flow, motion of tissue over time, the location of blood, the presence of specific molecules, the stiffness of tissue, or the anatomy of a three-dimensional region. Compared to other dominant methods of medical imaging, ultrasound has several advantages. It provides images in real-time and is portable and can be brought to the bedside. It is substantially lower in cost than other imaging modalities and does not use harmful ionizing radiation. Drawbacks include various limits on its field of view, such as the need for patient cooperation, dependence on physique, difficulty imaging structures behind bone and air or gases, and the necessity of a skilled operator, usually a trained professional.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_imaging | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_ultrasonography,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ability105616246 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Creativity105624700 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Invention105633385 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatGermanInventions | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatScottishInventions | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSwedishInventions | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

In the case of robotically-assisted minimally-invasive surgery, instead of directly moving the instruments, the surgeon uses one of two methods to administer the instruments. These include using a direct telemanipulator or through computer control. A telemanipulator is a remote manipulator that allows the surgeon to perform the normal movements associated with the surgery. The robotic arms carry out those movements using end-effectors and manipulators to perform the actual surgery. In computer-controlled systems, the surgeon uses a computer to control the robotic arms and its end-effectors, though these systems can also still use telemanipulators for their input. One advantage of using the computerized method is that the surgeon does not have to be present, leading to the possibility for remote surgery.

Finally, a re-imaging lens maps the dispersed image of the field stop onto a large-format detector array. Shown here is an example in which the device is imaging the university of Arizona's logo, uses a kinoform grating to disperse the transmitted light, and measures a 3 × 3 dispersion pattern on the detector array.

With a DACI, people with no or almost no residual hearing but with a still functioning inner ear, can again perceive speech, sounds and music.DACI is an official product category, as indicated by the nomenclature of GMDN. A DACI tries to provide an answer for people with hearing problems for which no solution exists today. People with some problems at the level of the cochlea can be helped with a hearing aid. A hearing aid will absorb the incoming sound from a microphone, and offer enhanced through the natural way. For larger reinforcements, this may cause problems with feedback and distortion. A hearing aid also simply provides more loudness, no more resolution. Users will view this often as, ""all sounds louder, but I understand nothing more than before.""Once a hearing aid offers no solution anymore, one can switch to a cochlear implant. A Cochlear implant captures the sound and sends it electrically, through the cochlea, to the auditory nerve. In this way, completely deaf patients can perceive sounds again.However, As soon as there are problems not only at the level of the cochlea, but also in the middle ear (the so-called conductive losses), then there are more efficient ways to get sound to the partially functioning cochlea.The most obvious solution is a BAHA, which brings the sound to the cochlea via bone conduction.However, patients who have both problems with the cochlea, as with the middle ear (i.e. patients with mixed losses), none of the above solutions is ideal.To this end, the direct acoustic cochlear implant was developed.

MRI is a medical imaging technique mostly used in radiology and nuclear medicine in order to investigate the anatomy and physiology of the body, and to detect pathologies including tumors, inflammation, neurological conditions such as stroke, disorders of muscles and joints, and abnormalities in the heart and blood vessels among others. Contrast agents may be injected intravenously or into a joint to enhance the image and facilitate diagnosis. Unlike CT and X-ray, MRI uses no ionizing radiation and is, therefore, a safe procedure suitable for diagnosis in children and repeated runs. Patients with specific non-ferromagnetic metal implants, cochlear implants, and cardiac pacemakers nowadays may also have an MRI in spite of effects of the strong magnetic fields. This does not apply on older devices, details for medical professionals are provided by the device's manufacturer. Certain atomic nuclei are able to absorb and emit radio frequency energy when placed in an external magnetic field. In clinical and research MRI, hydrogen atoms are most often used to generate a detectable radio-frequency signal that is received by antennas in close proximity to the anatomy being examined. Hydrogen atoms are naturally abundant in people and other biological organisms, particularly in water and fat. For this reason, most MRI scans essentially map the location of water and fat in the body. Pulses of radio waves excite the nuclear spin energy transition, and magnetic field gradients localize the signal in space. By varying the parameters of the pulse sequence, different contrasts may be generated between tissues based on the relaxation properties of the hydrogen atoms therein. When inside the magnetic field (B0) of the scanner, the magnetic moments of the protons align to be either parallel or anti-parallel to the direction of the field. While each individual proton can only have one of two alignments, the collection of protons appear to behave as though they can have any alignment. Most protons align parallel to B0 as this is a lower energy state. A radio frequency pulse is then applied, which can excite protons from parallel to anti-parallel alignment, only the latter are relevant to the rest of the discussion. In response to the force bringing them back to their equilibrium orientation, the protons undergo a rotating motion (precession), much like a spun wheel under the effect of gravity. The protons will return to the low energy state by the process of spin-lattice relaxation. This appears as a magnetic flux, which yields a changing voltage in receiver coils to give the signal. The frequency at which a proton or group of protons in a voxel resonates depends on the strength of the local magnetic field around the proton or group of protons, a stronger field corresponds to a larger energy difference and higher frequency photons. By applying additional magnetic fields (gradients) that vary linearly over space, specific slices to be imaged can be selected, and an image is obtained by taking the 2-D Fourier transform of the spatial frequencies of the signal (k-space). Due to the magnetic Lorentz force from B0 on the current flowing in the gradient coils, the gradient coils will try to move producing loud knocking sounds, for which patients require hearing protection.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Magnetic_resonance_imaging,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

The most commonly used compounds for contrast enhancement are gadolinium-based. Such MRI contrast agents shorten the relaxation times of nuclei within body tissues following oral or intravenous administration. In MRI scanners, sections of the body are exposed to a very strong magnetic field causing primarily the hydrogen nuclei (""spins"") of water in tissues to be polarized in the direction of the magnetic field. An intense radiofrequency pulse is applied that tips the magnetization generated by the hydrogen nuclei in the direction of the receiver coil where the spin polarization can be detected. Random molecular rotational oscillations matching the resonance frequency of the nuclear spins provide the ""relaxation"" mechanisms that bring the net magnetization back to its equilibrium position in alignment with the applied magnetic field. The magnitude of the spin polarization detected by the receiver is used to form the MR image but decays with a characteristic time constant known as the T1 relaxation time. Water protons in different tissues have different T1 values, which is one of the main sources of contrast in MR images. A contrast agent usually shortens, but in some instances increases, the value of T1 of nearby water protons thereby altering the contrast in the image.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:MRI_contrast_agents,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Agent109190918 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CausalAgent100007347 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMRIContrastAgents | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

This is necessary because the human hip is acted on by approximately 10-12 times the body weight and therefore the bone cement must absorb the forces acting on the hips to ensure that the artificial implant remains in place over the long term. Bone cement chemically is nothing more than Plexiglas (i.e. polymethyl methacrylate or PMMA). PMMA was used clinically for the first time in the 1940s in plastic surgery to close gaps in the skull. Comprehensive clinical tests of the compatibility of bone cements with the body were conducted before their use in surgery. The excellent tissue compatibility of PMMA allowed bone cements to be used for anchorage of head prostheses in the 1950s. Today several million procedures of this type are conducted every year all over the world and more than half of them routinely use bone cements - and the proportion is increasing. Bone cement is considered a reliable anchorage material with its ease of use in clinical practice and particularly because of its proven long survival rate with cemented-in prostheses. Hip and knee registers for artificial joint replacements such as those in Sweden and Norway clearly demonstrate the advantages of cemented-in anchorage.

His work Wall of History, a mural depicting centuries of African-American history, located at the entrance to downtown Fort Lauderdale's Sistrunk Boulevard, has been called his greatest achievement. Mills was born on December 14, 1920, in New York City and grew up in Harlem. He attended an arts high school in Manhattan. As a youth, Mills learned about his roots through his frequent visits to a collection of books on African-American culture and history located on the second floor of a building on 135th Street, a collection that was later placed in the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Mills served in the United States Army and after completing his military service worked as a medical illustrator at the VA Medical Center in Brooklyn. This was a position that his daughter described as having ""brought out the art in him"" and Mills would go on to spend two decades designing and illustrating medical books. He started designing fine art, after taking instruction at The Career School of Commercial Illustration in New York and at the Brooklyn Museum, with many of his works shown in collections and galleries in New York City. He moved to South Florida in 1985, settling in Fort Lauderdale. He taught at the Coral Springs Museum of Art, continued painting and had his works shown in area galleries and museums. His mural at the entrance to Sistrunk Boulevard in his adopted home town, commissioned by the City of Fort Lauderdale, have been considered his greatest work, telling the story of the African-American experience from slavery to modern times. In 2009, the Jim Moran Foundation honored him as an African-American Achiever for his six decades of painting and his focus on the African-American experience. Mills died at age 88 on October 20, 2009, at a hospice in Pembroke Pines, Florida.

However, this AV node stimulation can cause a delay in subsequent AV conduction by modifying the AV node's subsequent conduction characteristics. Hence, the P-R interval after the PVC is longer than the baseline P-R interval. Another variation on this concept is seen in atrial flutter. As a result of the rapid atrial rate, some of the atrial activity fails to get through the AV node in an antegrade direction but can alter the rate at which a subsequent atrial impulse is conducted.

The 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to South African American physicist Allan M. Cormack and British electrical engineer Godfrey N. Hounsfield ""for the development of computer assisted tomography."" Digital geometry processing is used to further generate a three-dimensional volume of the inside of the object from a small series of two-dimensional radiographic images taken around a single axis of rotation. Medical imaging is the most common application of X-ray CT. Its cross-sectional images are used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in various medical disciplines. The rest of this article discusses medical-imaging X-ray CT; industrial applications of X-ray CT are discussed at industrial computed tomography scanning. The term ""computed tomography"" (CT) is often used to refer to X-ray CT because it is the most commonly known form. But, many other types of CT exist, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). X-ray tomography, a predecessor of CT, is one form of radiography, along with many other forms of tomographic and non-tomographic radiography. CT produces data that can be manipulated in order to demonstrate various bodily structures based on their ability to absorb the X-ray beam. Although, historically, the images generated were in the axial or transverse plane, perpendicular to the long axis of the body, modern scanners allow this volume of data to be reformatted in various planes or even as volumetric (3D) representations of structures. Although most common in medicine, CT is also used in other fields, such as nondestructive materials testing. Another example is archaeological uses such as imaging the contents of sarcophagi or ceramics. Individuals responsible for performing CT exams are called radiographers or radiologic technologists. Use of CT has increased dramatically over the last two decades in many countries. An estimated 72 million scans were performed in the United States in 2007 and more than 80 million a year in 2015. One study estimated that as many as 0.4% of current cancers in the United States are due to CTs performed in the past and that this may increase to as high as 1.5 to 2% with 2007 rates of CT use; however, this estimate is disputed, as there is not a consensus about the existence of damage from low levels of radiation. Lower radiation doses are often used in many areas, such as in the investigation of renal colic. Side effects from intravenous contrast used in some types of studies include the possibility of exacerbating kidney problems in the setting of pre-existing kidney disease.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:X-ray_computed_tomography,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Experiment105798043 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/HigherCognitiveProcess105770664 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Inquiry105797597 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ProblemSolving105796750 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Process105701363 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thinking105770926 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Trial105799212 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTests | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

* induction of apoptosis, the so-called programmed cell death cascade. The most common application of cryoablation is to ablate solid tumors found in the lung, liver, breast, kidney and prostate. The use in prostate and renal cryoablation are the most common.

The focometer is monocular and hand-held, and is normally used in natural lighting. Patients rotate a collar on the focometer until the best focus is achieved. The individual's refractive power is then read off a linear dioptre scale. The focometer was developed by Drs. Ian Berger and Larry Spitzberg at the University of Houston College of Optometry in Houston, Texas, to provide a simple, inexpensive means for measuring refractive error in human vision. The portable, hand-held instrument is highly appropriate for use in remote and poor areas. Focometers measure spherical refractive errors. Astigmatism can also be measured using a ""clock target"" with the device. A study has found, however, that the focometer is less effective for identifying astigmatism than an autorefractor, and that its axis accuracy is limited to 15°. The advantages of a focometer over other methods for use in developing countries are that it is lightweight, compact, relatively inexpensive, fairly quick, and easy to use with minimal training. A clinical trial compared the repeatability, validity, and ease of use of the focometer with an autorefractor. It found that the focometer results were within 0.75 dioptres of the autorefractor value 84% of the time.

Unlike anal dildos, such as butt plugs, anal probes and anal beads, vibrating anal toys may produce various stimulating effects: rotating, vibrating or pulsating, and can have different speed or vibration levels to regulate and adjust the vibrator to various sensations.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Massage_devices | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Vibrators,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Plaything103964744 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMassageDevices | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSexToys

The primary purpose of a pacemaker is to maintain an adequate heart rate, either because the heart's natural pacemaker is not fast enough, or because there is a block in the heart's electrical conduction system. Modern pacemakers are externally programmable and allow a cardiologist, particularly a cardiac electrophysiologist to select the optimal pacing modes for individual patients. A specific type of pacemakers called defibrillator combines pacemaker and defibrillator functions in a single implantable device, which should be called only defibrillator, for clarity.

The company was known as Watson & Son (X-Ray) Ltd. until the merger in the late 1960's with A. E. Dean and Co. of Croydon. Watson and Sons had originally manufactured microscopes and other optical instruments, but in the late 19th century had seen the opportunity of making X-Ray equipment. They became part of GEC in the very early part of the 20th century. The main business of the merged GEC Medical was the manufacture of X-Ray equipment, including X-Ray tubes which were made under licence from a US company called Machlett Laboratories. Other products were the high voltage supplies needed for X-Ray tubes, the tables for positioning patients and many other accessories besides. It also employed a fairly large number of people supplying spare parts and servicing the pieces of equipment that were sold by the company. In the late 1980s the company introduced the concept of using a higher than mains frequency in an X-Ray power supply. One of the last products made by the company before it closed was a mammography unit.

The effective dose is not intended as a measure of deterministic health effects, which is the severity of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen, that is measured by the quantity absorbed dose.

CI bypasses the normal acoustic hearing process to replace it with electric signals which directly stimulate the auditory nerve. A person with a cochlear implant receiving intensive auditory training may learn to interpret those signals as sound and speech. However, one third of deaf children do not develop language if they are on a CI program alone and have no sign language input. The implant has two main components. The outside component is generally worn behind the ear, but could also be attached to clothing, for example, in young children. This component, the sound processor, contains microphones, electronics that include Digital Signal Processor chips, battery, and a coil which transmits a signal to the implant across the skin. The inside component, the actual implant, has a coil to receive signals, electronics, and an array of electrodes which is placed into the cochlea, which stimulate the cochlear nerve. The surgical procedure is performed under general anesthesia. Surgical risks are minimal but can include tinnitus, facial nerve bruising and dizziness. From the early days of implants in the 1970s and the 1980s, speech perception via an implant has steadily increased. Many users of modern implants gain reasonable to good hearing and speech perception skills post-implantation, especially when combined with lipreading. However, for pre-lingually deaf children the risk of not acquiring spoken language even with an implant may be as high as 30%. One of the challenges that remain with these implants is that hearing and speech understanding skills after implantation show a wide range of variation across individual implant users. Factors such as duration and cause of hearing loss, how the implant is situated in the cochlea, the overall health of the cochlear nerve, but also individual capabilities of re-learning are considered to contribute to this variation, yet no certain predictive factors are known. Despite providing the ability for hearing and oral speech communication to children and adults with severe to profound hearing loss, there is also controversy around the devices. Much of the strongest objection to cochlear implants has come from the Deaf community. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which as some view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine) | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_devices | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroprosthetics,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ability105616246 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Application100949134 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Creativity105624700 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Invention105633385 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Occupation100582388 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Profession100609953 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Technology100949619 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Use100947128 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatAustralianInventions | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatNASASpin-offTechnologies | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

These channels are slightly permeable to sodium ions, so they are also called Ca2+-Na+ channels, but their permeability to calcium is about 1000-fold greater than to sodium under normal physiological conditions. At physiologic or resting membrane potential, VGCCs are normally closed. They are activated (i.e., opened) at depolarized membrane potentials and this is the source of the ""voltage-gated"" epithet. The concentration of calcium (Ca2+ ions) is normally several thousand times higher outside the cell than inside. Activation of particular VGCCs allows a Ca2+ influx into the cell, which, depending on the cell type, results in activation of calcium-sensitive potassium channels, muscular contraction, excitation of neurons, up-regulation of gene expression, or release of hormones or neurotransmitters. VGCCs have been immunolocalized in the zona glomerulosa of normal and hyperplastic human adrenal, as well as in aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA), and in the latter T-type VGCCs correlated with plasma aldosterone levels of patients. Excessive activation of VGCCs is a major component of excitotoxicity, as severely elevated levels of intracellular calcium activates enzymes which, at high enough levels, can degrade essential cellular structures.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Biomolecule | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Protein | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q206229 | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8054

Palatal obturators are not to be confused with palatal lifts or other prosthetic devices. A palatal obturator may be used in cases of a deficiency in tissue, when a remaining opening in the palate occurs. In some cases it may be downsized gradually so that tissue can strengthen over time and compensate for the decreasing size of the obturator. The palatal lift however, is used when there is not enough palatal movement. It raises the palate and reduces the range of movement necessary to provide adequate closure to separate the nasal cavity from the oral cavity.  and palatal lifts aid in  and do not obturate a fistula. A speech bulb, yet another type of prosthetic device often confused with a palatal obturator, contains a pharyngeal section, which goes behind the soft palate.

The biological pacemaker is intended as an alternative to the artificial cardiac pacemaker that's been in human use since the late 1950s. Despite their success, several limitations and problems with artificial pacemakers have emerged during the past decades such as electrode fracture or damage to insulation, infection, re-operations for battery exchange, and venous thrombosis. The need for an alternative is most obvious in children, including premature newborn babies, where size mismatch and the fact that pacemaker leads do not grow with children are a problem. A more biological approach has been taken in order to mitigate many of these issues.

They are sometimes contrasted with a brain–computer interface, which connects the brain to a computer rather than a device meant to replace missing biological functionality. Neural prostheses are a series of devices that can substitute a motor, sensory or cognitive modality that might have been damaged as a result of an injury or a disease. Cochlear implants provide an example of such devices. These devices substitute the functions performed by the eardrum and stapes while simulating the frequency analysis performed in the cochlea. A microphone on an external unit gathers the sound and processes it; the processed signal is then transferred to an implanted unit that stimulates the auditory nerve through a microelectrode array. Through the replacement or augmentation of damaged senses, these devices intend to improve the quality of life for those with disabilities. These implantable devices are also commonly used in animal experimentation as a tool to aid neuroscientists in developing a greater understanding of the brain and its functioning. By wirelessly monitoring the brain's electrical signals sent out by electrodes implanted in the subject's brain, the subject can be studied without the device affecting the results. Accurately probing and recording the electrical signals in the brain would help better understand the relationship among a local population of neurons that are responsible for a specific function. Neural implants are designed to be as small as possible in order to be minimally invasive, particularly in areas surrounding the brain, eyes or cochlea. These implants typically communicate with their prosthetic counterparts wirelessly. Additionally, power is currently received through wireless power transmission through the skin. The tissue surrounding the implant is usually highly sensitive to temperature rise, meaning that power consumption must be minimal in order to prevent tissue damage. The neuroprosthetic currently undergoing the most widespread use is the cochlear implant, with over 300,000 in use worldwide as of 2012.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine) | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroprosthetics,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Application100949134 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Occupation100582388 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Profession100609953 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Technology100949619 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Use100947128 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatEmergingTechnologies | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

Integrated CBCT is also an important tool for patient positioning and verification in image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). During dental/orthodontic imaging, the CBCT scanner rotates around the patient's head, obtaining up to nearly 600 distinct images. For interventional radiology, the patient is positioned offset to the table so that the region of interest is centered in the field of view for the cone beam. A single 200 degree rotation over the region of interest acquires a volumetric data set. The scanning software collects the data and reconstructs it, producing what is termed a digital volume composed of three-dimensional voxels of anatomical data that can then be manipulated and visualized with specialized software. CBCT shares many similarities with traditional (fan beam) CT however there are important differences, particularly for reconstruction. CBCT has been described as the gold standard for imaging the oral and maxillofacial area.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:X-ray_computed_tomography,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

The same material can be used as a casting resin or in inks and coatings, among many other uses. Although not a type of familiar silica-based glass, the substance, like many thermoplastics, is often technically classified as a type of glass (in that it is a non-crystalline vitreous substance) hence its occasional historical designation as acrylic glass. Chemically, it is the synthetic polymer of methyl methacrylate. The material was developed in 1928 in several different laboratories by many chemists, such as William Chalmers, Otto Röhm, and Walter Bauer, and was first brought to market in 1933 by German Röhm & Haas AG (as of January 2019 part of Evonik Industries) and its partner and former U.S. affiliate Rohm and Haas Company under the trademark Plexiglas. PMMA is an economical alternative to polycarbonate (PC) when tensile strength, flexural strength, transparency, polishability, and UV tolerance are more important than impact strength, chemical resistance, and heat resistance. Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful bisphenol-A subunits found in polycarbonate and is a far better choice for laser cutting. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when under load, especially under an impact force, and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA is sometimes able to achieve high scratch and impact resistance.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Chemical114806838 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Compound114818238 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ester114850483 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Insulator114821590 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/OrganicCompound114727670 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Polymer114994328 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCarboxylateEsters | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDentalMaterials | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDielectrics | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatOpticalMaterials | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatPolymers | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatTransparentMaterials | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ChemicalCompound | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ChemicalSubstance | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Drug | http://umbel.org/umbel/rc/ChemicalSubstanceType | http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#ChemicalObject | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11173

The fibrils are isolated from any cellulose containing source including wood-based fibers (pulp fibers) through high-pressure, high temperature and high velocity impact homogenization, grinding or microfluidization (see manufacture below). Nanocellulose can also be obtained from native fibers by an acid hydrolysis, giving rise to highly crystalline and rigid nanoparticles which are shorter (100s to 1000 nanometers) than the cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) obtained through homogenization, microfluiodization or grinding routes.

The three-dimensional map is therefore a valuable aid to the examining ophthalmologist or optometrist and can assist in the diagnosis and treatment of a number of conditions; in planning cataract surgery and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation (plano or toric IOLs); in planning refractive surgery such as LASIK, and evaluating its results; or in assessing the fit of contact lenses.

It is stated to help in improving mobility and stability of the ankle joint on CP patients, evidence shows that immediate gross motor function improved with the use of DAFO’s as well. Designed to help a patient maintain a functional position, a DAFO can improve stability for successful standing and walking. Different from a traditional Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO), which is typically stiff and rigid, a DAFO is characteristically thin, flexible and wraps around the patient’s entire foot in order to provide improved sensation and alignment. Initially designed for use by pediatric patients but now sometimes used by the adult population, a DAFO encourages range of motion, allowing children to learn movement by moving and providing minimal support, only where the patient needs it. DAFOs are frequently prescribed to assist with mobility and motor skills of children with cerebral palsy, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, clubfoot and autism. The concept for the original DAFO was developed in 1985 as collaboration between Don Buethorn, CPO, and Nancy M. Hylton, PT, LO. The two worked together to create a thin, flexible brace that would meet the needs of pediatric patients with neurodevelopment challenges and the result was the creation of a Washington state-based company, Cascade Dafo, Inc. Evolution:Initially dynamic Ankle Foot Orthoses were designed to stimulate or inhibate certain muscles in order to control lower leg spasticity by the application of pressure zones on the foot. The concept was further developed and DAFO's are now prescribed in order to re-align and maintain the foot so that gross motor function is improved, especially for CP patients. Indications :It is indicated for patients with flat valgus foot from 5 to 10 years old.Patients with mild deformity of the foot. Advantages: -Increases stride length, reduce excessive plantar flexion for CP children.-Increases child's stability by realignment of the foot -Improves the gross motor skills of children with cerebral palsy. Limitations: -Combination of stiff and flexible material has to be accurate. -Accurate marking of the pressure and relief points have to be realized by an experienced orthotist.-Standards of manufacturing varies within suppliers and researchers.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Orthopedic_braces,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Brace102887209 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Strengthener104336034 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Support104359589 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatOrthopedicBraces

The basis for modern dental implants is a biologic process called osseointegration, in which materials such as titanium form an intimate bond to bone.

A variable amount of healing time is required for osseointegration before either the dental prosthetic (a tooth, bridge or denture) is attached to the implant or an abutment is placed which will hold a dental prosthetic/crown. Success or failure of implants depends on the health of the person receiving the treatment, drugs which affect the chances of osseointegration, and the health of the tissues in the mouth. The amount of stress that will be put on the implant and fixture during normal function is also evaluated. Planning the position and number of implants is key to the long-term health of the prosthetic since biomechanical forces created during chewing can be significant. The position of implants is determined by the position and angle of adjacent teeth, by lab simulations or by using computed tomography with CAD/CAM simulations and surgical guides called stents. The prerequisites for long-term success of osseointegrated dental implants are healthy bone and gingiva. Since both can atrophy after tooth extraction, pre-prosthetic procedures such as sinus lifts or gingival grafts are sometimes required to recreate ideal bone and gingiva. The final prosthetic can be either fixed, where a person cannot remove the denture or teeth from their mouth, or removable, where they can remove the prosthetic. In each case an abutment is attached to the implant fixture. Where the prosthetic is fixed, the crown, bridge or denture is fixed to the abutment either with lag screws or with dental cement. Where the prosthetic is removable, a corresponding adapter is placed in the prosthetic so that the two pieces can be secured together. The risks and complications related to implant therapy divide into those that occur during surgery (such as excessive bleeding or nerve injury), those that occur in the first six months (such as infection and failure to osseointegrate) and those that occur long-term (such as peri-implantitis and mechanical failures). In the presence of healthy tissues, a well-integrated implant with appropriate biomechanical loads can have 5-year plus survival rates from 93 to 98 percent and 10 to 15 year lifespans for the prosthetic teeth. Long-term studies show a 16- to 20-year success (implants surviving without complications or revisions) between 52% and 76%, with complications occurring up to 48% of the time.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Dental_equipment | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MedicalProcedure101024392 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Operation100671351 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDentalMaterials | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSurgicalProcedures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Non-medically licensed alternative practitioners who are not held to the same standard may offer thermography services but that should not be confused with the field of medical thermology. Restated, medical thermology is the use of infrared (IR) imaging to assess skin temperature as an extension of the clinician's physical exam to aid in the formation of a medical diagnosis or treatment plan. Medical Thermology does not condone those who purport that ""Thermography"" can find disease by looking for areas of the body that have abnormal heat or irregular blood flow. IR imaging simply does not does not have the ability to assess temperature beyond the surface of the skin. Thermography is a physiologic study and is not a replacement for structural studies such as X-Ray, MRI, or Mammography. As a physiologic study however, medical thermology has many health related indications. The American Academy of Thermology (AAT) (www.aathermology.org) has published internationally peer reviewed guidelines for neuro-musculoskeletal (MSK), breast, veterinary, and oral-systemic disease. Examples of neuro-musculoskeletal indications for medical thermology include Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD), Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), Dystautonomia, Migraine, Fibromyalgia (and other weather sensitive pain syndromes), thoracic outlet syndrome, and vaso- motor migraine/head aches such as Barre-Lieou syndrome. This is especially true when used to monitor the results of a cold stress (cold presser) test. While there are several clinical studies showing the effectiveness of thermography in detecting temperature abnormalities of breast skin, breast thermography is only approved as an adjunct modality only for breast disease and/or cancer. In that regard it is a breast risk health assessment only. A summary of some of the clinical trials for breast thermography is available in this white paper from UE LifeSciences pdf. Veterinary thermography indications include, but are not limited to, assessment of shoring, limb inflammation, and sweating disorders. When properly used, a commonly known oral-systemic indication for IR imaging is temperature measurement for fever screening. While there are several other oral-systemic indications out lined in the American Academy of Thermology's Oral -Systemic Guidelines. Whole body studies are not performed for medical purposes.

Another, different, surgical instrument also called a leucotome was introduced by Walter Freeman for use in the transorbital lobotomy. Modeled after an ice-pick, it consisted simply of a pointed shaft. It was passed through the tear duct under the eyelid and against the top of the eyesocket. A mallet was used to drive the instrument through the thin layer of bone and into the brain along the plane of the bridge of the nose, to a depth of 5 cm. Due to incidents of breakage, a stronger but essentially identical instrument called an orbitoclast was later used. Lobotomies were commonly performed from the 1930s to the 1960s, with a few as late as the 1980s in France.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Surgical_instruments,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrument103574816 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MedicalInstrument103739693 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/SurgicalInstrument104364545 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSurgicalInstruments

Another use of syringe drivers is in palliative care, to continuously administer analgesics (painkillers), antiemetics (medication to suppress nausea and vomiting) and other drugs. This prevents periods during which medication levels in the blood are too high or too low, and avoids the use of multiple tablets (especially in people who have difficulty swallowing). As the medication is administered subcutaneously, the area for administration is practically limitless, although edema may interfere with the action of some drugs. Syringe drivers are also useful for delivering IV medications over several minutes. In the case of a medication which should be slowly pushed in over the course of several minutes, this device saves staff time and reduces errors. Syringe pumps are also useful in microfluidic applications, such as microreactor design and testing, and also in chemistry for slow incorporation of a fixed volume of fluid into a solution.

For example, a person weighing 75 kg with burns to 20% of his or her body surface area would require 4 x 75 x 20 = 6,000 mL of fluid replacement within 24 hours. The first half of this amount is delivered within 8 hours from the burn incident, and the remaining fluid is delivered in the next 16 hours.

Hyperspectral imaging measures contiguous spectral bands, as opposed to multispectral imaging which measures spaced spectral bands. The main idea - for chemical imaging, the analyst may choose to take as many data spectrum measured at a particular chemical component in spatial location at time; this is useful for chemical identification and quantification. Alternatively, selecting an image plane at a particular data spectrum (PCA - multivariable data of wavelength, spatial location at time) can map the spatial distribution of sample components, provided that their spectral signatures are different at the selected data spectrum. Software for chemical imaging is most specific and distinguished from chemical methods such as chemometrics. Imaging instrumentation has three components: a radiation source to illuminate the sample, a spectrally selective element, and usually a detector array (the camera) to collect the images. The data format is called a hypercube. The data set may be visualized as a data cube, a three-dimensional block of data spanning two spatial dimensions (x and y), with a series of wavelengths (lambda) making up the third (spectral) axis. The hypercube can be visually and mathematically treated as a series of spectrally resolved images (each image plane corresponding to the image at one wavelength) or a series of spatially resolved spectra.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Magnetic_resonance_imaging,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ability105616246 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Know-how105616786 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Method105660268 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Technique105665146 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatFluorescenceTechniques

The AL is intended to take over some of the functionality of biological lungs. It is different from a heart-lung machine in that it is external and designed to take over the functions of the lungs for long periods of time rather than on a temporary basis. The heart-lung machine inspired the design of AL devices, however, modern ALs are optimised to minimize patient trauma. Following the development of the heart-lung machine, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) was developed. This was intended to be used as a bridge to lung transplant (BTT), for patients too sick to wait until a donor lung was available. Mechanical Ventilation (MV) has also been used, however, it is damaging to the patient's lungs if used for extended periods of time. Both these therapies are expensive and are associated with poor quality of life, in part due to complex blood circuits required for these techniques to work. Recent developments include simplifying the ECMO system, and devices that use 380 micron wide hollow fibers to simulate the function of alveoli have been developed. Several research groups, notably, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Michigan, University of Maryland and Boston based groups are developing AL devices to bridge patients to lung transplant.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/BodyPart105220461 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Organ105297523 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part109385911 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thing100002452 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatArtificialOrgans

Symptoms can begin within an hour and may last for several months. Symptoms within the first few days typically include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. This is followed by a few hours or weeks with little symptoms which later develops into additional symptoms followed by either recovery or death. Acute radiation syndrome involves a total dose of greater than 0.7 Gy (70 rads), that generally occurs from a source outside the body within minutes. Sources of such radiation can occur accidentally or intentionally. They may involve nuclear reactors, cyclotrons, and certain devices used in cancer therapy. It is generally divided into three types; bone marrow, gastrointestinal, and neurovascular syndrome, with bone marrow syndrome occurring at 0.7 to 10 Gy, and neurovascular syndrome occurring at doses that exceed 50 Gy. The cells that are most affected are generally those that are rapidly dividing. At high doses, this causes DNA damage that may be irreparable. Diagnosis is based on a history of exposure and symptoms. Repeated complete blood counts (CBCs) can indicate the severity of exposure. Treatment of acute radiation syndrome is generally supportive care. This may include blood transfusions, antibiotics, colony-stimulating factors, or stem cell transplant. If radioactive material remains on the skin or in the stomach it should be removed. If radioiodine was breathed in or ingested, potassium iodide may be recommended. Complications such as leukemia and other cancers among those who survive are managed as usual. Short term outcomes depend on the exposure dose. ARS is generally rare. A single event, however, can affect a relatively large number of people. Notable cases occurred following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster.

The term ""forceps"" is used almost exclusively within the medical field. Outside medicine, people usually refer to forceps as tweezers, tongs, pliers, clips or clamps. Mechanically, forceps employ the principle of the lever to grasp and apply pressure. Depending on their function, basic surgical forceps can be categorized into the following groups: 1.  
* Non-disposable forceps. They should withstand various kinds of physical and chemical effects of body fluids, secretions, cleaning agents, and sterilization methods. 2.  
* Disposable forceps. They are usually made of lower-quality materials or plastics which are disposed after use. Surgical forceps are commonly made of high-grade carbon steel, which ensures they can withstand repeated sterilization in high-temperature autoclaves. Some are made of other high-quality stainless steel, chromium and vanadium alloys to ensure durability of edges and freedom from rust. Lower-quality steel is used in forceps made for other uses. Some disposable forceps are made of plastic. The invention of surgical forceps is attributed to Stephen Hales. There are two basic types of forceps: non-locking (often called ""thumb forceps"" or ""pick-ups"") and locking, though these two types come in dozens of specialized forms for various uses. Non-locking forceps also come in two basic forms: hinged at one end, away from the grasping end (colloquially such forceps are called tweezers) and hinged in the middle, rather like scissors. Locking forceps are almost always hinged in the middle, though some forms place the hinge very close to the grasping end. Locking forceps use various means to lock the grasping surfaces in a closed position to facilitate manipulation or to independently clamp, grasp or hold an object.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_clamps,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

This channel has four subunits (Cav1.1, Cav1.2, Cav1.3, Cav1.4). L-type calcium channels are responsible for the excitation-contraction coupling of skeletal, smooth, cardiac muscle, and for aldosterone secretion in endocrine cells of the adrenal cortex. They are also found in neurons, and with the help of L-type calcium channels in endocrine cells, they regulate neurohormones and neurotransmitters. They have also been seen to play a role in gene expression, mRNA stability, neuronal survival, ischemic-induced axonal injury, synaptic efficacy, and both activation and deactivation of other ion channels. In cardiac myocytes, the L-type calcium channel passes inward Ca2+ current and triggers calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by activating ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) (calcium-induced-calcium-release). Phosphorylation of these channels increases their permeability to calcium and increases the contractility of their respective cardiac myocytes. L-type calcium channel blocker drugs are used as cardiac antiarrhythmics or antihypertensives, depending on whether the drugs have higher affinity for the heart (the phenylalkylamines, like verapamil), or for the blood vessels (the dihydropyridines, like nifedipine).

It allows the application of ultrasound technology, such as piezoelectric transducer or CMUT, to see from inside blood vessels out through the surrounding blood column, visualizing the endothelium (inner wall) of blood vessels in living individuals. The arteries of the heart (the coronary arteries) are the most frequent imaging target for IVUS. IVUS is used in the coronary arteries to determine the amount of atheromatous plaque built up at any particular point in the epicardial coronary artery. Intravascular ultrasound provides a unique method to study the regression or progression of atherosclerotic lesions in vivo. The progressive accumulation of plaque within the artery wall over decades is the setup for vulnerable plaque which, in turn, leads to heart attack and stenosis (narrowing) of the artery (known as coronary artery lesions). IVUS is of use to determine both plaque volume within the wall of the artery and/or the degree of stenosis of the artery lumen. It can be especially useful in situations in which angiographic imaging is considered unreliable; such as for the lumen of ostial lesions or where angiographic images do not visualize lumen segments adequately, such as regions with multiple overlapping arterial segments. It is also used to assess the effects of treatments of stenosis such as with hydraulic angioplasty expansion of the artery, with or without stents, and the results of medical therapy over time.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_ultrasonography,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatVascularProcedures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

The former investigates potential fluctuations time locked to an event, such as 'stimulus onset' or 'button press'. The latter analyses the type of neural oscillations (popularly called ""brain waves"") that can be observed in EEG signals in the frequency domain. EEG is most often used to diagnose epilepsy, which causes abnormalities in EEG readings. It is also used to diagnose sleep disorders, depth of anesthesia, coma, encephalopathies, and brain death. EEG used to be a first-line method of diagnosis for tumors, stroke and other focal brain disorders, but this use has decreased with the advent of high-resolution anatomical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Despite limited spatial resolution, EEG continues to be a valuable tool for research and diagnosis. It is one of the few mobile techniques available and offers millisecond-range temporal resolution which is not possible with CT, PET or MRI. Derivatives of the EEG technique include evoked potentials (EP), which involves averaging the EEG activity time-locked to the presentation of a stimulus of some sort (visual, somatosensory, or auditory). Event-related potentials (ERPs) refer to averaged EEG responses that are time-locked to more complex processing of stimuli; this technique is used in cognitive science, cognitive psychology, and psychophysiological research.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Application100949134 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Experiment105798043 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/HigherCognitiveProcess105770664 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Inquiry105797597 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Occupation100582388 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ProblemSolving105796750 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Process105701363 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Profession100609953 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Technology100949619 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thinking105770926 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Trial105799212 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Use100947128 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatEmergingTechnologies | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTests | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PersonFunction | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Campbell went on to become one of the pioneers too, publishing papers on fetal biometry, and developing charts of fetal measurements such the biparietal diameter and head circumference, and formulae for estimating fetal weight using ultrasound. He went on to work at Queen Charlotte's Hospital in London, before being appointed Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at King's College Hospital, where he established a fetal medicine unit of international renown (now Harris-Birthright Research Centre for Fetal Medicine), where other leading fetal medicine practitioners such as Kypros Nicolaides, and Charles Rodeck would later train and work. Campbell's work went on to describe the use of ultrasound to diagnose fetal anomalies, and then the use of Doppler ultrasound, in particular uteroplacental Doppler, in the assessment of 'high-risk' pregnancies. Campbell went on to become Professor of Obstetrics & Gynaecology at St George's Hospital Medical School before his retirement. He was founding President of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology (ISUOG), and the first editor of the journal Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology (The White Journal), one of the leading peer-reviewed journals on imaging within obstetrics and gynaecology. In 1992 he was awarded the Ian Donald Gold Medal of ISUOG in recognition of his contribution to ultrasound in obstetrics & gynecology, with over 400 peer-reviewed publications to his name at the time. Since 2001 Campbell has been a consultant at CREATE Fertility, which was set up to provide the latest techniques in Reproductive Medicine, Antenatal and Gynaecological scanning. He has developed his interest in 3D and 4D (moving 3D) imaging and has published papers on a novel method of diagnosing cleft palate. In this work he collaborated with two colleagues at Addenbrookes Hospital, Christoph Lees ( Director of Fetal Medicine), who now has become Professor of Obstetrics and works at Queen Charlotte's Hospital, and Per Hall, oro-facial surgeon. The technique called the reverse face view provides detailed and reliable information on congenital defects of the fetal palate; hitherto only defects of the lips and alveolus could be visualised by existing techniques. He was also the first to describe patterns of fetal behaviour such as blinking, smiling, crying and reflexes in early pregnancy. Many of his images and moving 3D sequences of fetal behaviour have been used in television documentaries such as ""My Fetus"", ""Life Before Birth"" and ""In The Womb"".

The name ""Robstep"" is a portmanteau of the words ""robot"" and ""step"", meaning robotic steps. The devices have been compared to Segways. Computers and motors inside of the device keep the Robstep upright when powered on with balancing enabled. A user commands the Robstep to go forward by shifting their weight forward on the platform, and backward by shifting their weight backward. The Robstep detects, as it balances, the change in its center of mass, and first establishes and then maintains a corresponding speed, forward or backward. Gyroscopic sensors and fluid-based level sensors detect the weight shift. To turn, the user presses the handlebar to the left or the right.Robsteps are driven by electric motors and can reach a speed of 9.3 miles per hour (15 km/h). Robsteps are comparable to Segways. They are known as human transporters and personal mobility devices. Some customers use them as a disability device. There are now two different types of batteries fitted on these devices. One is considered a dangerous good for airline travel (lithium ion) and the other type is acceptable (nickel metal hydride).

It should not be confused with defibrillation (used in more serious cases, in ventricular fibrillation and other shockable rhythms) using a manual or automatic defibrillator, though some newer defibrillators can do both, and pads and an electrical stimulus to the heart are used in transcutaneous pacing and defibrillation. Transcutaneous pacing is accomplished by delivering pulses of electric current through the patient's chest, which stimulates the heart to contract. The most common indication for transcutaneous pacing is an abnormally slow heart rate. By convention, a heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute in the adult patient is called bradycardia. Not all instances of bradycardia require medical treatment. Normal heart rate varies substantially between individuals, and many athletes in particular have a relatively slow resting heart rate.  In addition, the heart rate is known to naturally slow with age. It is only when bradycardia presents with signs and symptoms of shock that it requires emergency treatment with transcutaneous pacing. Some common causes of hemodynamically significant bradycardia include myocardial infarction, sinus node dysfunction and complete heart block. Transcutaneous pacing is no longer indicated for the treatment of asystole (cardiac arrest associated with a ""flat line"" on the ECG), with the possible exception of witnessed asystole (as in the case of bifascicular block that progresses to complete heart block without an escape rhythm). During transcutaneous pacing, pads are placed on the patient's chest, either in the anterior/lateral position or the anterior/posterior position. The anterior/posterior position is preferred as it minimizes transthoracic electrical impedance by ""sandwiching"" the heart between the two pads. The pads are then attached to a monitor/defibrillator, a heart rate is selected, and current (measured in milliamps) is increased until electrical capture (characterized by a wide QRS complex with tall, broad T wave on the ECG) is obtained, with a corresponding pulse. Pacing artifact on the ECG and severe muscle twitching may make this determination difficult. It is therefore advisable to use another instrument (e.g. SpO2 monitor or bedside doppler) to confirm mechanical capture. Transcutaneous pacing may be uncomfortable for the patient. Sedation should therefore be considered. Before pacing the patient in a prehospital setting sedation is recommended by administering an analgesic or an anxiolytic. Prolonged transcutaneous pacing may cause burns on the skin. According to the Zoll M Series Operator's Guide,"" Continuous pacing of neonates can cause skin burns. If it is necessary to pace for more than 30 minutes, periodic inspection of the underlying skin is strongly advised."" It is meant to stabilize the patient until a more permanent means of pacing is achieved. Other forms of cardiac pacing are transvenous pacing, epicardial pacing, and permanent pacing with an implantable pacemaker. In addition to synchronized transcutaneous pacing offered by newer cardiac monitor/defibrillators, there is also an option for asynchronous pacing. Sometimes in the prehospital setting a situation may arise where ECG electrodes are not available or something interferes with their adhesion to the patient's skin. In these rare situations where the patient must be paced and there are no other alternatives, asynchronous pacing may be used. Again, this setting should only be used as a last resort due to possible adverse cardiac effects it could cause.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cardiac_electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MedicalProcedure101024392 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatEmergencyMedicalProcedures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

A correspondence between BOLD and SEEP signal changes, and sites of activity, has been observed in the brain and appears to arise from the common dependence on changes in local blood flow to cause a change in blood oxygenation or to produce extracellular fluid (7, 8). The advantage of SEEP contrast is that it can be detected with MR imaging methods which are relatively insensitive to magnetic susceptibility differences between air, tissues, blood, and bone. Such susceptibility differences can give rise to spatial image distortions and areas of low signal, and magnetic susceptibility changes in blood give rise to the BOLD contrast for fMRI. The primary application of SEEP to date has been fMRI of the spinal cord (spinal fMRI) because the bone/tissue interfaces around the spinal cord cause poor image quality with conventional fMRI methods. The disadvantages of SEEP compared to BOLD contrast are that it reveals more localized areas of activity, and in the brain the signal intensity changes are typically lower, and it can therefore be more difficult to detect (7-10).It is also controversial because it is not universally agreed to exist as a contrast mechanism for fMRI.However, more recent studies have demonstrated changes in MRI signal corresponding with changes in neuronal activity in rat cortical tissue slices, in the absence of blood flow or changes in oxygenation, and neuronal activity and cellular swelling were corroborated by light-transmittance microscopy.This demonstrated SEEP contrast in the absence of confounding factors which can occur in-vivo, such as physiological motion and the possibility of concurrent BOLD contrast.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroimaging,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Stochastic health effects are those that occur by chance, and whose probability is proportional to the dose, but whose severity is independent of the dose. The LNT model assumes there is no lower threshold at which stochastic effects start, and assumes a linear relationship between dose and the stochastic health risk. In other words, LNT assumes that radiation has the potential to cause harm at any dose level, and the sum of several very small exposures is just as likely to cause a stochastic health effect as a single larger exposure of equal dose value. In contrast, deterministic health effects are radiation-induced effects such as acute radiation syndrome, which are caused by tissue damage. Deterministic effects reliably occur above a threshold dose and their severity increases with dose. Because of the inherent differences, LNT is not a model for deterministic effects, which are instead characterized by other types of dose-response relationships. LNT is a common model to calculate the probability of radiation-induced cancer both at high doses where epidemiology studies support its application but, controversially, also at low doses, which is a dose region that has a lower predictive statistical confidence. Nonetheless, regulatory bodies commonly use LNT as a basis for regulatory dose limits to protect against stochastic health effects, as found in many public health policies.There are three active (as of 2016) challenges to the LNT model currently being considered by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. One was filed by Nuclear Medicine Professor Carol Marcus of UCLA, who calls the LNT model scientific ""baloney"". Whether the model describes the reality for small-dose exposures is disputed. It opposes two competing schools of thought: the threshold model, which assumes that very small exposures are harmless, and the radiation hormesis model, which claims that radiation at very small doses can be beneficial. Because the current data is inconclusive, scientists disagree on which model should be used. Pending any definitive answer to these questions and the precautionary principle, the model is sometimes used to quantify the cancerous effect of collective doses of low-level radioactive contaminations, even though it estimates a positive number of excess deaths at levels that would have had zero deaths, or saved lives, in the two other models. Such practice has been condemned by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. One of the organizations for establishing recommendations on radiation protection guidelines internationally, the UNSCEAR, recommended policies in 2014 that do not agree with the LNT model at exposure levels below background levels. The recommendation states ""the Scientific Committee does not recommend multiplying very low doses by large numbers of individuals to estimate numbers of radiation-induced health effects within a population exposed to incremental doses at levels equivalent to or lower than natural background levels."" This is a reversal from previous recommendations by the same organization.

For patients for whom transvenous pacing is chosen, the procedure is done at the bedside with a local anesthetic alone or in conjunction with conscious sedation. The pacing electrode is advanced through the vein under fluoroscopic and electrocardiographic guidance. An x-ray after the procedure is always obtained to confirm placement of the pacing electrode.

The DASB image from a human PET scan shows high binding in the midbrain, thalamus and striatum, moderate binding in the medial temporal lobe and anterior cingulate, and low binding in neocortex.The cerebellum is often regarded as a region with no specific serotonin transporter binding and the brain region is used as a reference in some studies. Since the serotonin transporter is the target of SSRIs used in the treatment of major depression it has been natural to examine DASB binding in depressed patients.Several such research studies have been performed. There are a number of alternative PET radioligands for imaging the serotonin transporter: [11C], [11C], [11C]AFM, [11C]DAPA, [11C]McN5652, and [11C]-NS 4194.A related molecule to DASB, that can be labeled with fluorine-18, has also been suggested as a PET radioligand. With single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using the radioisotope iodine-123 there are further radioligands available: [123I]ODAM, [123I]IDAM, [123I]ADAM, and [123I]β-CIT.A few studies have examined the difference in binding between the radioligands in nonhuman primates, as well as in pigs.

Nitinol alloys exhibit two closely related and unique properties: the shape memory effect and superelasticity (also called pseudoelasticity). Shape memory is the ability of nitinol to undergo deformation at one temperature, stay in its deformed shape when the external force is removed, then recover its original, undeformed shape upon heating above its ""transformation temperature"". Superelasticity is the ability for the metal to undergo large deformations and immediately return to its undeformed shape upon removal of the external load. Nitinol can deform 10-30 times as much as ordinary metals and return to its original shape. Whether nitinol behaves with the shape memory effect or superelasticity depends on whether it is above the transformation temperature of the specific alloy.

In the developed world, the most frequent type in use is the continuous-flow anaesthetic machine or ""Boyle's machine"", which is designed to provide an accurate supply of medical gases mixed with an accurate concentration of anaesthetic vapour, and to deliver this continuously to the patient at a safe pressure and flow. This is distinct from intermittent-flow anaesthetic machines, which provide gas flow only on demand when triggered by the patient's own inspiration. Simpler anaesthetic apparatus may be used in special circumstances, such as the , a simplified anaesthesia delivery system invented for the British Defence Medical Services, which is light and portable and may be used for ventilation even when no medical gases are available.

A golden rule is that there has to be collateral circulation to the area affected by the chosen artery, so that peripheral circulation is maintained by another artery even if circulation is disturbed in the cannulated artery. Insertion is often painful; an anesthetic such as lidocaine can be used to make the insertion more tolerable and to help prevent vasospasm, thereby making insertion of the arterial line somewhat easier.

The pump can continually monitor the left ventricle, which allows for perpetual observation of the hearts condition. This allows for any necessary changes to be made when needed. The pump operates at speeds between two hundred and ninety and four hundred and seventy revolutions per minute. The Hemopump Cardiac Assist System is an older design intra-arterial, axial-flow pump circulatory assist device concept that offers temporary left ventricular support to patients in refractory cardiogenic shock without requiring major surgery for insertion. The Hemopump draws blood with the impeller from the left ventricle and then exchanges it through the aorta. It can run at a constant speed, or two variable speeds during the cardiac cycle. Volume of the stroke, the rotating speed, or the pressure can all be tuned. These different setting are used for different conditions of the heart. It is optimal to run at two different speeds through a cardiac cycle as opposed to a constant speed. Running the pump at maximum capacity can be dangerous as it has led to complete collapse of the left ventricle in animal trials. When in use there was low risk involved with the use of the Hemopump. There were not been many complications in patients that had used the pump. Any complications resulting in morbidity were seen to be rare. The Hemopump was deemed safe for use in community hospitals and it was expected that the number of patients supported by this device would increase.

By 1870, amputation blades had become straighter, and more closely resembled the ""Liston"" European style. Since the Crimean War ended in 1856, it is likely the American Civil War had a greater impact on long slender blade style than the actual Dr. Liston. The dedicated task of amputation may be more responsible for the Liston title than any specific design. It is noted by collectors that the handles on earlier knives (pre-1850) are of a much bigger and heavier construction. The majority of the history of amputation blade evolution is referenced from the medical textbook Handbook of Surgical Operations, U.S.A.

The aim of intermittent hypoxic training or  conducted with such a device is to obtain benefits in physical performance and wellbeing through improved oxygen metabolism. There are several commercial systems available. Most of these systems have not been cleared for medical applications by the FDA and are used by athletes for altitude training. Advanced hypoxicators have a built-in pulse oximeter used to monitor and in some cases control the temporary reduction of arterial oxygen saturation that results in physiological responses evident at both systemic and cellular levels even after only a few minutes of hypoxia. Hypoxic Training Index (HTi) can be used to measure the delivered therapeutic dosage over the training session. The underlying mechanisms of adaptation to mild, non-damaging, short-term (minutes) hypoxic stress (also called - intermittent hypoxic training) are complex and diverse, but are part of normal physiology and are opposite to patho-physiological effects of severe sleep apnea hypoxia. There are a number of types of hypoxicators that can be distinguished by the method of producing hypoxic air and its delivery to the user's respiratory system. Commonly used are air separation systems employing semi-permeable membrane technology or pressure swing adsorption or (PSAS). There are also non-powered hand-held devices – . The term hypoxicator was suggested by Russian scientists in 1985 to describe a new class of devices for Intermittent hypoxic training (IHT) – an emerging drug-free treatment for a wide range of degenerative disorders and forsimulated altitude training used to achieve greater endurance performance as well as offering pre-acclimatisation for mountaineers – minimising the risk of succumbing to acute mountain sickness on a subsequent ascent. The hypoxia challenge of IHT is normally delivered in an intermittent manner: 3-7 min of hypoxic air breathing alternated with 1-5 min of normoxic or hyperoxic air. The hypoxicator allows automated and pre-programmed delivery of the required hypoxic and hyperoxic or normoxic air and safety monitoring. The therapeutic range of arterial oxygen desaturation for IHT is SpO2 =75% - 88% and must be selected based upon the recommendation of a medical specialist. Studies have also shown that hypoxic air treatment may increase the recovery speed and endurance of spinal cord injuries. There are no reported adverse effects associated with this kind of treatment. However, symptoms of over-training may appear as a result of abusing basic training protocols supplied by manufacturers. Products that do not offer effective and instant monitoring and control over the treatment sessions must be avoided. Pulse oximeters should be used to monitor the level of arterial oxygensaturation that is the basic measure of hypoxic training dosage. Good brands have pulse oximeters integrated into the system and the best hypoxicators are equipped with automated biofeedback hypoxic training control mechanisms. This type of equipment has been validated as a cost-effective and safe method of assessing respiratory patients' response to the reduced levels of oxygen onboard commercial passenger flights.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_pumps,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MechanicalDevice103736970 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Mechanism103738472 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Pump104021798 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalPumps

In many animals, electrical synapse-based systems co-exist with chemical synapses. Compared to chemical synapses, electrical synapses conduct nerve impulses faster, but, unlike chemical synapses, they lack gain—the signal in the postsynaptic neuron is the same or smaller than that of the originating neuron. The fundamental bases for perceiving electrical synapses comes down to the connexons that are located in the gap junction between two neurons. Electrical synapses are often found in neural systems that require the fastest possible response, such as defensive reflexes. An important characteristic of electrical synapses is that they are mostly bidirectional (allow impulse transmission in either direction).",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Anatomy106057539 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Biology106037666 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Content105809192 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Discipline105996646 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/KnowledgeDomain105999266 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LifeScience106037298 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Morphology106078327 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/NaturalScience106000400 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Science105999797 | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/AnatomicalStructure | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4936952

Usually mouthwashes are antiseptic solutions intended to reduce the microbial load in the oral cavity, although other mouthwashes might be given for other reasons such as for their analgesic, anti-inflammatory or anti-fungal action. Additionally, some rinses act as saliva substitutes to neutralize acid and keep the mouth moist in xerostomia (dry mouth). Cosmetic mouthrinses temporarily control or reduce bad breath and leave the mouth with a pleasant taste. Rinsing with water or mouthwash after brushing with a fluoride toothpaste can reduce the availability of salivary fluoride. This can lower the anti-cavity re-mineralization and antibacterial effects of fluoride. Fluoridated mouthwash may mitigate this effect or in high concentrations increase available fluoride.

One important tool used in many of these procedures is a catheter used to deliver many of things a surgeon needs to do his work, to impact target tissue and deliver a variety of medicines or disinfecting agents to treat disease or infection. Manufactured by Hansen Medical, Sensei X is a specialized robotic catheter system that is controlled by a physician and is designed for accurate positioning, manipulation and stable control of catheter and catheter-based technologies during cardiovascular procedures. The Sensei system obtained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance in 2007, after which the Cleveland Clinic's electrophysiology program, then directed by Dr. Andrea Natale, received the first placement. The Sensei Robotic Catheter System and Artisan Extend Control Catheter allow physicians to navigate flexible catheters with greater stability and control during complex cardiac arrhythmia procedures. Hansen Medical has related co-development agreements with the following industry leaders: St. Jude Medical, GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthcare, and Philips Medical Systems. Hansen Medical was founded by Dr. Frederic Moll, who had also co-founded Intuitive Surgical, manufacturer of the Da Vinci Surgical System, whose use has propelled medicinal robotics to the forefront of patient care. The Sensei system is indicated for use during the cardiac mapping phase of cardiac arrhythmia treatment in the US. Meanwhile, it has CE mark approval for facilitating the navigation of ablation catheters within the atria of the heart during complex arrhythmia procedures such as Atrial Fibrillation (AF). In November 2010, Hansen Medical received unconditional Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval from the FDA initiating a clinical trial to investigate the use of the Sensei X Robotic Catheter System and the Artisan Control Catheter for treatment of AF, the most common cardiac arrhythmia. The Principal Investigator of the ARTISAN AF Trial is Dr. Andrea Natale, executive medical director for Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute (TCAI). The first case in the trial was completed by Dr. Joseph Gallinghouse, an electrophysiologist, at the TCAI at St. David's Medical Center. By the end of 2010, nearly 100 Sensei systems have been shipped worldwide since its 2007 release. The system has been used to perform almost 5,000 procedures. The Sensei system operates by guiding standard catheters through a manipulated robotically steerable sheath (hollow tube) in the patient's vasculature. The doctor performs the procedure at a control station with a technology called ""IntelliSense"" to proximally measure the forces applied along the shaft of the catheter as a result of catheter tissue contact. The Artisan catheter has two robotically controlled segments which provides six degrees of freedom and 270 degrees of bend articulation which can assist physicians in accessing hard-to-reach cardiac anatomy. The open lumen Artisan catheter accommodates 8F percutaneous EP catheters.

Given their important functionalities and the relative small invasiveness, the electrocardiography techniques are used quite often as clinical diagnostic tests. Thus, it is natural to proceed to computationally reproduce an ECG, which means to mathematically model the cardiac behaviour inside the body. The three main parts of a forward model for the ECG are: 
* a model for the cardiac electrical activity; 
* a model for the diffusion of the electrical potential inside the torso, which represents the extracardiac region; 
* some specific heart-torso coupling conditions. Thus, to obtain an ECG, a mathematical electrical cardiac model must be considered, coupled with a diffusive model in a passive conductor that describes the electrical propagation inside the torso. The coupled model is usually a three-dimensional model expressed in terms of partial differential equations (PDE). Such model is typicalli solved by means of finite element method (FEM) for the solution's space evolution and  involving finite differences for the solution's time evolution. However, the computational costs of such techniques, especially with three dimensional simulations, are quite high. Thus, simplified models are often considered, solving for example the heart electrical activity independently from the problem on the torso. To provide realistic results, three dimensional anatomically-realistic models of the heart and the torso must be used.

Depolarization is essential to the function of many cells, communication between cells, and the overall physiology of an organism. Most cells in higher organisms maintain an internal environment that is negatively charged relative to the cell's exterior. This difference in charge is called the cell's membrane potential. In the process of depolarization, the negative internal charge of the cell temporarily becomes more positive (less negative). This shift from a negative to a more positive membrane potential occurs during several processes, including an action potential. During an action potential, the depolarization is so large that the potential difference across the cell membrane briefly reverses polarity, with the inside of the cell becoming positively charged. The change in charge typically occurs due to an influx of sodium ions into a cell, although it can be mediated by an influx of any kind of cation or efflux of any kind of anion. The opposite of a depolarization is called a hyperpolarization. Usage of the term ""depolarization"" in biology differs from its use in physics.

Changes in the normal ECG pattern occur in numerous cardiac abnormalities, including cardiac rhythm disturbances (such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia), inadequate coronary artery blood flow (such as myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction), and electrolyte disturbances (such as hypokalemia and hyperkalemia). In a conventional 12-lead ECG, ten electrodes are placed on the patient's limbs and on the surface of the chest. The overall magnitude of the heart's electrical potential is then measured from twelve different angles (""leads"") and is recorded over a period of time (usually ten seconds). In this way, the overall magnitude and direction of the heart's electrical depolarization is captured at each moment throughout the cardiac cycle. There are three main components to an ECG: the P wave, which represents the depolarization of the atria; the QRS complex, which represents the depolarization of the ventricles; and the T wave, which represents the repolarization of the ventricles. During each heartbeat, a healthy heart has an orderly progression of depolarization that starts with pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node, spreads throughout the atrium, and passes through the atrioventricular node down into the bundle of His and into the Purkinje fibers, spreading down and to the left throughout the ventricles. This orderly pattern of depolarization gives rise to the characteristic ECG tracing. To the trained clinician, an ECG conveys a large amount of information about the structure of the heart and the function of its electrical conduction system. Among other things, an ECG can be used to measure the rate and rhythm of heartbeats, the size and position of the heart chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart's muscle cells or conduction system, the effects of heart drugs, and the function of implanted pacemakers.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cardiac_electrophysiology | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Softgels are produced in a process known as encapsulation using the Rotary Die Encapsulation process invented by Robert Pauli Scherer. The encapsulation process has been described as a form/fill/seal process. Two flat ribbons of shell material are manufactured on the machine and brought together on a twin set of rotating dies. The dies contain recesses in the desired size and shape, which cut out the ribbons into a two-dimensional shape, and form a seal around the outside. At the same time a pump delivers a precise dose of fill material through a nozzle incorporated into a filling wedge whose tip sits between the two ribbons in between two die pockets at the point of cut out. The wedge is heated to facilitate the sealing process. The wedge injection causes the two flat ribbons to expand into the die pockets, giving rise to the three-dimensional finished product. After encapsulation, the softgels are dried for two days to two weeks depending on the product.

DPIs are commonly used to treat respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, emphysema and COPD although DPIs (such as Inhalable insulin) have also been used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. DPIs are an alternative to the aerosol-based inhalers commonly called metered-dose inhaler (or MDI). The DPIs may require some procedure to allow a measured dose of powder to be ready for the patient to take. The medication is commonly held either in a capsule for manual loading or a proprietary from inside the inhaler. Once loaded or actuated, the operator puts the mouthpiece of the inhaler into their mouth and takes a sharp, deep inhalation (ensuring that the medication reaches the lower parts of the lungs), holding their breath for 5–10 seconds. There are a variety of such devices. The dose that can be delivered is typically less than a few tens of milligrams in a single breath since larger powder doses may lead to provocation of cough. Most DPIs rely on the force of patient inhalation to entrain powder from the device and subsequently break-up the powder into particles that are small enough to reach the lungs. For this reason, insufficient patient inhalation flow rates may lead to reduced dose delivery and incomplete deaggregation of the powder, leading to unsatisfactory device performance. Thus, most DPIs have a minimum inspiratory effort that is needed for proper use and it is for this reason that such DPIs are normally used only in older children and adults.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Care100654885 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Form106290637 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LanguageUnit106284225 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Treatment100658082 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDosageForms | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTreatments | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Word106286395 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Work100575741 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Whelan in June 2009, the first living artist so honored. According to his Hall of Fame citation Michael Whelan is one of the most important contemporary science fiction and fantasy artists, and certainly the most popular. His work was a dominant force in the transition of genre book covers away from the surrealism introduced in the 1950s and 1960s back to realism. His paintings have appeared on the covers of more than 350 books and magazines, including many Stephen King novels, most of the Del Rey editions of Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series, Piers Anthony's Incarnations of Immortality series, the Del Rey edition of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars series, Melanie Rawn's Dragon Prince and Dragon Star series, the Del Rey editions of H. P. Lovecraft's short story collections, the DAW editions of Michael Moorcock's Elric of Melniboné books, numerous DAW editions of C. J. Cherryh's work, many of Robert A. Heinlein's novels including Friday and The Cat Who Walks Through Walls, the Ace editions of H. Beam Piper's Fuzzy novels, and Tad Williams's Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, Otherland, and Shadowmarch series and Brandon Sanderson's The Stormlight Archive. Whelan provided covers and interior illustrations for Stephen King's The Gunslinger and The Dark Tower, the first and last of his Dark Tower books. Cover art by Michael Whelan has graced many music record albums including Demolition Hammer's Epidemic of Violence, The Jacksons' Victory; Sepultura's Beneath the Remains, Arise, Chaos A.D. and Roots; Soulfly's Dark Ages; Obituary's Cause of Death; and every album by the Elric-influenced metal band Cirith Ungol.

Modern MDCT (multi-detector CT) scanners are able to deliver images of sufficient resolution within a short time period, such that CTPA has now supplanted previous methods of testing, such as direct pulmonary angiography, as the gold standard for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. The patient receives an intravenous injection of an iodine-containing contrast agent at a high-rate using an injector pump. Images are acquired with the maximum intensity of radio-opaque contrast in the pulmonary arteries. This can be done using bolus tracking. A normal CTPA scan will show the contrast filling the pulmonary vessels, appearing as bright white.

It may also be referred to by the brand names Terylene in the UK, Lavsan in Russia and the former Soviet Union, and Dacron in the US. The majority of the world's PET production is for synthetic fibres (in excess of 60%), with bottle production accounting for about 30% of global demand. In the context of textile applications, PET is referred to by its common name, polyester, whereas the acronym PET is generally used in relation to packaging. Polyester makes up about 18% of world polymer production and is the fourth-most-produced polymer after polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). PET consists of polymerized units of the monomer ethylene terephthalate, with repeating (C10H8O4) units. PET is commonly recycled, and has the number ""1"" as its resin identification code (RIC). Depending on its processing and thermal history, polyethylene terephthalate may exist both as an amorphous (transparent) and as a semi-crystalline polymer. The semicrystalline material might appear transparent (particle size less than 500 nm) or opaque and white (particle size up to a few micrometers) depending on its crystal structure and particle size. The monomer bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate can be synthesized by the esterification reaction between terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol with water as a byproduct, or by transesterification reaction between ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) with methanol as a byproduct.

Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in companies who have sought the solution to this long-standing problem. Approaches that have been tried include near infrared spectroscopy (measuring glucose through the skin using light of slightly longer wavelengths than the visible region), transdermal measurement (attempting to pull glucose through the skin using either chemicals, electricity or ultrasound), measuring the amount that polarized light is rotated by glucose in the front chamber of the eye (containing the aqueous humor), and many others. A 2012 study reviewed ten technologies: bioimpedance spectroscopy, microwave/RF sensing, fluorescence technology, mid-infrared spectroscopy, near infrared spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography, optical polarimetry, raman spectroscopy, reverse iontophoresis, and ultrasound technology, concluding with the observation that none of these had produced a commercially available, clinically reliable device and that therefore, much work remained to be done. As of 2014, disregarding the severe shortcomings mentioned above, at least one noninvasive glucose meter was being marketed in a number of countries.

In its most common (transmissive) application mode, a sensor device is placed on a thin part of the patient's body, usually a fingertip or earlobe, or in the case of an infant, across a foot. The device passes two wavelengths of light through the body part to a photodetector. It measures the changing absorbance at each of the wavelengths, allowing it to determine the absorbances due to the pulsing arterial blood alone, excluding venous blood, skin, bone, muscle, fat, and (in most cases) nail polish. Reflectance pulse oximetry is a less common alternative to transmissive pulse oximetry. This method does not require a thin section of the person's body and is therefore well suited to a universal application such as the feet, forehead, and chest, but it also has some limitations. Vasodilation and pooling of venous blood in the head due to compromised venous return to the heart can cause a combination of arterial and venous pulsations in the forehead region and lead to spurious SpO2 results.

Medical imaging also establishes a database of normal anatomy and physiology to make it possible to identify abnormalities. Although imaging of removed organs and tissues can be performed for medical reasons, such procedures are usually considered part of pathology instead of medical imaging. As a discipline and in its widest sense, it is part of biological imaging and incorporates radiology, which uses the imaging technologies of X-ray radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, endoscopy, elastography, tactile imaging, thermography, medical photography, and nuclear medicine functional imaging techniques as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Measurement and recording techniques that are not primarily designed to produce images, such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and others, represent other technologies that produce data susceptible to representation as a parameter graph vs. time or maps that contain data about the measurement locations. In a limited comparison, these technologies can be considered forms of medical imaging in another discipline. As of 2010, 5 billion medical imaging studies had been conducted worldwide. Radiation exposure from medical imaging in 2006 made up about 50% of total ionizing radiation exposure in the United States. Medical imaging equipment are manufactured using technology from the semiconductor industry, including CMOS integrated circuit chips, power semiconductor devices, sensors such as image sensors (particularly CMOS sensors) and biosensors, and processors such as microcontrollers, microprocessors, digital signal processors, media processors and system-on-chip devices. As of 2015, annual shipments of medical imaging chips amount to 46 million units and $1.1 billion. Medical imaging is often perceived to designate the set of techniques that noninvasively produce images of the internal aspect of the body. In this restricted sense, medical imaging can be seen as the solution of mathematical inverse problems. This means that cause (the properties of living tissue) is inferred from effect (the observed signal). In the case of medical ultrasound, the probe consists of ultrasonic pressure waves and echoes that go inside the tissue to show the internal structure. In the case of projectional radiography, the probe uses X-ray radiation, which is absorbed at different rates by different tissue types such as bone, muscle, and fat. The term ""noninvasive"" is used to denote a procedure where no instrument is introduced into a patient's body, which is the case for most imaging techniques used.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_imaging | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Nuclear_medicine,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/MusicGenre | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Oscillatory activity in groups of neurons generally arises from feedback connections between the neurons that result in the synchronization of their firing patterns. The interaction between neurons can give rise to oscillations at a different frequency than the firing frequency of individual neurons. A well-known example of macroscopic neural oscillations is alpha activity. Neural oscillations were observed by researchers as early as 1924 (by Hans Berger). More than 50 years later, intrinsic oscillatory behavior was encountered in vertebrate neurons, but its functional role is still not fully understood. The possible roles of neural oscillations include feature binding, information transfer mechanisms and the generation of rhythmic motor output. Over the last decades more insight has been gained, especially with advances in brain imaging. A major area of research in neuroscience involves determining how oscillations are generated and what their roles are. Oscillatory activity in the brain is widely observed at different levels of organization and is thought to play a key role in processing neural information. Numerous experimental studies support a functional role of neural oscillations; a unified interpretation, however, is still lacking.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Communication100033020 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ComputerArchitecture106725249 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Description106724763 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Message106598915 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/NeuralNetwork106725467 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Specification106725067 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Statement106722453 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatNeuralNetworks | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Most implanted pacemakers are dual chambered and have two leads, causing the implantation time to take longer because of this more complicated pacemaker system. These factors can contribute to an increased rate of complications which can lead to pacemaker failure. Approximately 2.25 million pacemakers were implanted in the United States between 1990 and 2002, and of those pacemakers, about 8,834 were removed from patients because of device malfunction most commonly connected to generator abnormalities. In the 1970s, results of an Oregon study indicated that 10% of implanted pacemakers failed within the first month. Another study found that more than half of pacemaker complications occurred during the first 3 months after implantation. Causes of pacemaker failure include lead related failure, unit malfunction, problems at the insertion site, failures related to exposure to high voltage electricity or high intensity microwaves, and a miscellaneous category (one patient had ventricular tachycardia when using his electric razor and another patient had persistent pacing of the diaphragm muscle). Pacemaker malfunction has the ability to cause serious injury or death, but if detected early enough, patients can continue with their needed therapy once complications are resolved.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Corrective103111899 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Implant103563710 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Prosthesis104013729 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/System104377057 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatEmbeddedSystems | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatImplants | http://umbel.org/umbel/rc/AilmentCondition

Dahl knew Wade to be an expert in precision hydraulic engineering, from their shared hobby of flying model aircraft. (In addition to building his own model aircraft engines, Wade ran a factory at High Wycombe for producing precision hydraulic pumps.) With Dahl coordinating the efforts of the neurosurgeon and the hydraulic engineer, the team developed a new mechanism using two metal discs, each in a restrictive housing at the end of a short silicone rubber tube. Fluid moving under pressure from below pushed the discs against the tube to prevent retrograde flow; pressure from above moved each disc to the ""open"" position. As Till reported in The Lancet, the invention was characterized by “low resistance, ease of sterilisation, no reflux, robust construction, and negligible risk of blockage”. By the time the device was perfected, Theo had healed to the point at which it was no longer necessary to implant the shunt in his skull. However, several thousand other children around the world benefited from the WDT valve before medicine technology progressed beyond it.

Smoking is primarily practised as a route of administration for recreational drug use because the combustion of the dried plant leaves vaporizes and delivers active substances into the lungs where they are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and reach bodily tissue. In the case of cigarette smoking these substances are contained in a mixture of aerosol particles and gases and include the pharmacologically active alkaloid nicotine; the vaporization creates heated aerosol and gas into a form that allows inhalation and deep penetration into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream of the active substances occurs. In some cultures, smoking is also carried out as a part of various rituals, where participants use it to help induce trance-like states that, they believe, can lead them to spiritual enlightenment. Smoking generally has negative health effects, because smoke inhalation inherently poses challenges to various physiologic processes such as respiration. Diseases related to tobacco smoking have been shown to kill approximately half of long-term smokers when compared to average mortality rates faced by non-smokers. Smoking caused over five million deaths a year from 1990 to 2015. Smoking is one of the most common forms of recreational drug use. Tobacco smoking is the most popular form, being practised by over one billion people globally, of whom the majority are in the developing countries. Less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium. Some of the substances are classified as hard narcotics, like heroin, but the use of these is very limited as they are usually not commercially available. Cigarettes are primarily industrially manufactured but also can be hand-rolled from loose tobacco and rolling paper. Other smoking implements include pipes, cigars, bidis, hookahs, and bongs. Smoking can be dated to as early as 5000 BCE, and has been recorded in many different cultures across the world. Early smoking evolved in association with religious ceremonies; as offerings to deities, in cleansing rituals or to allow shamans and priests to alter their minds for purposes of divination or spiritual enlightenment. After the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, the practice of smoking tobacco quickly spread to the rest of the world. In regions like India and Sub-Saharan Africa, it merged with existing practices of smoking (mostly of cannabis). In Europe, it introduced a new type of social activity and a form of drug intake which previously had been unknown. Perception surrounding smoking has varied over time and from one place to another: holy and sinful, sophisticated and vulgar, a panacea and deadly health hazard. In the 20th century, smoking came to be viewed in a decidedly negative light, especially in Western countries. This is due to smoking tobacco being among the leading causes of many diseases such as lung cancer, heart attack, COPD, erectile dysfunction, and birth defects. The health hazards of smoking have caused many countries to institute high taxes on tobacco products, run ads to discourage use, limit ads that promote use, and provide help with quitting for those who do smoke.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Usually the parameter I, which means the current that enters the neuron, is taken as a control parameter. Other control parameters used often in the literature are a, b, c, d, or r, the first four modeling the working of the fast ion channels and the last one the slow ion channels, respectively. Frequently, the parameters held fixed are s = 4 and xR = -8/5. When a, b, c, d are fixed the values given are a = 1, b = 3, c = 1, and d = 5. The parameter r governs the time scale of the neural adaptation and is something of the order of 10−3, and I ranges between −10 and 10.

The Holter's most common use is for monitoring ECG heart activity (electrocardiography or ECG). Its extended recording period is sometimes useful for observing occasional cardiac arrhythmias which would be difficult to identify in a shorter period. For patients having more transient symptoms, a cardiac event monitor which can be worn for a month or more can be used. The Holter monitor was developed at the Holter Research Laboratory in Helena Montana by experimental physicists Norman J. Holter and Bill Glasscock, who started work on radio telemetry in 1949. Inspired by a suggestion from cardiologist Paul Dudley White in the early 1950s, they redirected their efforts toward development of a wearable cardiac monitoring device. The Holter monitor was released for commercial production in 1962. When used to study the heart, much like standard electrocardiography, the Holter monitor records electrical signals from the heart via a series of electrodes attached to the chest. Electrodes are placed over bones to minimize artifacts from muscular activity. The number and position of electrodes varies by model, but most Holter monitors employ between three and eight. These electrodes are connected to a small piece of equipment that is attached to the patient's belt or hung around the neck, keeping a log of the heart's electrical activity throughout the recording period. A 12 lead Holter system is also available when precise ECG signal information is required to analyse the exact nature and origin of the rhythm signal.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_monitoring_equipment,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ability105616246 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Creativity105624700 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Eponym106334985 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Invention105633385 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LanguageUnit106284225 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Name106333653 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatAmericanInventions | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCardiacProcedures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatEponyms | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

It is commonly employed in delivery systems of intravenous therapy and acts to prevent air embolism. The use of a drip chamber also allows an estimate of the rate at which fluid is administered. For a fluid of a given viscosity, drips from a hole of known size will be of nearly identical volume, and the number of drips in a minute can be counted to gauge the rate of flow. In this instance the rate of flow is usually controlled by a clamp on the infusion tubing; this affects the resistance to flow. However, other sources of resistance (such as whether the vein is kinked or compressed by the patient's position) cannot be so directly controlled and a change in position may change the rate of flow leading to inadvertently rapid or slow infusion. Where this might be problematic an infusion pump can be used which gives a more accurate measurement of flow rate. Drip chambers can be classified into macro-drip (about 10 to 20 gtts/ml) and micro-drip (about 60 gtts/ml) based on their drop factors. For a given drip chamber (when the fluid drips from the hole into the chamber) drop factor means number of drops per ml of the IV fluid. Flow rate can be calculated with the help of the observations from the drip chamber and its drop factor. The unit of flow rate is gtts/min, where gtts means guttae (Latin plural noun meaning “drops”).",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDrugDeliveryDevices

AHPs have been segregated into ""fast"", ""medium"", and ""slow"" components that appear to have distinct ionic mechanisms and durations. While fast and medium AHPs can be generated by single action potentials, slow AHPs generally develop only during trains of multiple action potentials. During single action potentials, transient depolarization of the membrane opens more voltage-gated K+ channels than are open in the resting state, many of which do not close immediately when the membrane returns to its normal resting voltage. This can lead to an ""undershoot"" of the membrane potential to values that are more polarized (""hyperpolarized"") than was the original resting membrane potential. Ca2+-activated K+ channels that open in response to the influx of Ca2+ during the action potential carry much of the K+ current as the membrane potential becomes more negative. The K+ permeability of the membrane is transiently unusually high, driving the membrane voltage VM even closer to the K+ equilibrium voltage EK. Hence, hyperpolarization persists until the membrane K+ permeability returns to its usual value. Medium and slow AHP currents also occur in neurons. The ionic mechanisms underlying medium and slow AHPs are not yet well understood, but may also involve M current and HCN channels for medium AHPs, and ion-dependent currents and/or ionic pumps for slow AHPs.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCellularProcesses | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

During this state, a motor unit has been maximally stimulated by its motor neuron and remains that way for some time. This occurs when a muscle's motor unit is stimulated by multiple impulses at a sufficiently high frequency. Each stimulus causes a twitch. If stimuli are delivered slowly enough, the tension in the muscle will relax between successive twitches. If stimuli are delivered at high frequency, the twitches will overlap, resulting in tetanic contraction. A tetanic contraction can be either unfused (incomplete) or fused (complete). An unfused tetanus is when the muscle fibers do not completely relax before the next stimulus because they are being stimulated at a fast rate; however there is a partial relaxation of the muscle fibers between the twitches. Fused tetanus is when there is no relaxation of the muscle fibers between stimuli and it occurs during a high rate of stimulation. A fused tetanic contraction is the strongest single-unit twitch in contraction. When tetanized, the contracting tension in the muscle remains constant in a steady state. This is the maximal possible contraction. During tetanic contractions, muscles can shorten, lengthen or remain constant length. Tetanic contraction is usually normal (such as when holding up a heavy box). Muscles often exhibit some level of tetanic activity, leading to muscle tone, in order to maintain posture; for example, in a crouching position, some muscles require sustained contraction to hold the position. Tetanic contraction can exist in a variety of states, including isotonic and isometric forms—for example, lifting a heavy box off the floor is isotonic, but holding it at the elevated position is isometric. Voluntary sustained contraction is a normal (physiologic) process (as in the crouching or box-holding examples), but involuntary sustained contraction exists on a spectrum from physiologic to disordered (pathologic). Muscle tone is a healthy form of involuntary sustained partial contraction. In comparison with tetanic contraction in an isometric state (such as holding up a heavy box for several minutes), it differs only in the percentage of motor units participating at any moment and the frequency of neural signals; but the low percentage and low frequency in healthy tone are the key factors defining it as healthy (and not tetanic). Involuntary sustained contraction of a hypertonic type, however, is a pathologic process. On the mild part of the spectrum, cramps, spasms, and even tetany are often temporary and nonsevere. On the moderate to severe parts of the spectrum are dystonia, trismus, pathologic tetanus, and other movement disorders featuring involuntary sustained strong contractions of skeletal muscle.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ability105616246 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Attribute100024264 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Clue106643763 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Communication100033020 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Condition113920835 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Disorder114052403 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Evidence106643408 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Indication106797169 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MetabolicDisorder114084502 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalCondition114034177 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Sign106646243 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Skill105637558 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/State100024720 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalSigns | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMetabolicDisorders | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMotorSkills

Geminus started work in England by working with Thomas Raynalde and producing ""The byrth of Mankinde"" aka ""The Woman's booke"" in 1545. ""The byrth of Mankinde"", was the best English language reference work on midwifery in the 1500s. Its text was translated from Eucharius Rösslin's ""Der schwangern Frauwen und Hebammen Rosengarten"". Its first English edition was a 1540 translation by Richard Jonas. The second, by Thomas Raynalde, appeared in 1545 and saw many editions in the next 100 years. It discussed fertility, pregnancy, birth, and infant care, with the best anatomical descriptions then available. Its illustrations were again after Vesalius via Geminus’s ""Compendiosa"". The ""Compendiosa totius anatomie"" consisted of 41 unnumbered engraved sheets and was dedicated to Edward VI. One of the sheets was a fold-out engraving of the external anatomy of Adam and Eve; in addition there were 3 engravings of the skeleton, 16 of the muscles, 5 of the arteries and veins, 4 of the nerves, 6 of the organs, 4 of the brain, and one of the eye and its parts, all after woodcuts by Vesalius. The Latin edition of 1545 had been distributed in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and other countries. Geminus wrote in the later English version that it had been produced for the benefit of ""unlatined Surgeons"". He had employed Nicholas Udall, the playwright, to translate some of the work, while the text was taken from an early translation of Henri de Mondeville's ""Surgery"". The book was a great success, printing three editions in England - one in Latin (1545) and two in English translation (1553 and 1559). In his engraved copies, Geminus removed all the detail he regarded as superfluous, notably the background landscapes which had informed Vesalius's images. The copperplate engravings were the first ever to be done in England, and enjoyed a large following in France. Jacques Grévin, the French poet who also happened to be a physician and writer on matters medical, had print editions done from Geminus's plates in 1564, 1565 and a French translation in 1569.

The stress response is induced by exercise or by intravenous pharmacological stimulation. Cardiac stress tests compare the coronary circulation while the patient is at rest with the same patient's circulation during maximum cardiac exertion, showing any abnormal blood flow to the myocardium (heart muscle tissue). The results can be interpreted as a reflection on the general physical condition of the test patient. This test can be used to diagnose coronary artery disease (also known as ischemic heart disease) and assess patient prognosis after a myocardial infarction (heart attack). Exercise-induced stressors are most commonly either exercise on a treadmill or pedalling a stationary exercise bicycle ergometer. The level of stress is progressively increased by raising the difficulty (steepness of the slope on a treadmill or resistance on an ergometer) and speed. People who cannot use their legs may exercise with a bicycle-like crank that they turn with their arms. Once the stress test is completed, the patient generally is advised to not suddenly stop activity but to slowly decrease the intensity of the exercise over the course of several minutes. The test administrator or attending physician examines the symptoms and blood pressure response. To measure the heart's response to the stress the patient may be connected to an electrocardiogram (ECG); in this case the test is most commonly called a cardiac stress test but is known by other names, such as exercise testing, stress testing treadmills, exercise tolerance test, stress test or stress test ECG. Alternatively a stress test may use an echocardiogram for ultrasonic imaging of the heart (in which case the test is called an echocardiography stress test or stress echo), or a gamma camera to image radioisotopes injected into the bloodstream (called a nuclear stress test).",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Nuclear_medicine,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Experiment105798043 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/HigherCognitiveProcess105770664 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Inquiry105797597 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ProblemSolving105796750 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Process105701363 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thinking105770926 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Trial105799212 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCardiacProcedures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTests | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

In general, cracks are hard to detect at an early stage, and manual intervention is required for periodic inspections and repairs.

Some self-healing materials are classed as smart structures, and can adapt to various environmental conditions according to their sensing and actuation properties. Although the most common types of self-healing materials are polymers or elastomers, self-healing covers all classes of materials, including metals, ceramics, and cementitious materials. Healing mechanisms vary from an instrinsic repair of the material to the addition of a repair agent contained in a microscopic vessel. For a material to be strictly defined as autonomously self-healing, it is necessary that the healing process occurs without human intervention. Self-healing polymers may, however, activate in response to an external stimulus (light, temperature change, etc.) to initiate the healing processes. A material which can intrinsically correct damage caused by normal usage could prevent costs incurred by material failure and lower costs of a number of different industrial processes through longer part lifetime, and reduction of inefficiency caused by degradation over time.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSmartMaterials

Laudanum is known as a ""whole opium"" preparation since it historically contained all the opium alkaloids. Today, however, the drug is often processed to remove all or most of the noscapine (also called narcotine) present as this is a strong emetic and does not add appreciably to the analgesic or antipropulsive properties of opium; the resulting solution is called Denarcotized Tincture of Opium or Deodorized Tincture of Opium (DTO). Laudanum remains available by prescription in the United States and theoretically in the United Kingdom, although today the drug's therapeutic indications are generally confined to controlling diarrhea, alleviating pain, and easing withdrawal symptoms in infants born to mothers addicted to heroin or other opioids. Recent enforcement action by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) against manufacturers of paregoric and opium tincture suggests that opium tincture's availability in the U.S. may be in jeopardy.

Common side effects include vomiting, constipation, sedation, confusion, hallucinations, and injuries related to poor coordination. Serious side effects may include decreased breathing (respiratory depression), serotonin syndrome, low blood pressure, addiction, or coma. Fentanyl works primarily by activating μ-opioid receptors. It is around 100 times stronger than morphine, and some analogues such as carfentanil are around 10,000 times stronger. Fentanyl was first made by Paul Janssen in 1960 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1968. In 2015, 1,600 kilograms (3,500 lb) were used in healthcare globally.

Different types of stainless steel include the elements carbon (from 0.03% to greater than 1.00%), nitrogen, aluminium, silicon, sulfur, titanium, nickel, copper, selenium, niobium, and molybdenum. Specific types of stainless steel are often designated by a three-digit number, e.g., 304 stainless. Stainless steel's resistance to ferric oxide formation results from the presence of chromium in the alloy, which forms a passive film that protects the underlying material from corrosion attack, and can self-heal in the presence of oxygen. Corrosion resistance can be increased further, by: 
* increasing the chromium content to levels above 11%; 
* addition of 8% or higher amounts of nickel; and 
* addition of molybdenum (which also improves resistance to ""pitting corrosion""). The addition of nitrogen also improves resistance to pitting corrosion and increases mechanical strength. Thus, there are numerous grades of stainless steel with varying chromium and molybdenum contents to suit the environment the alloy must endure. Resistance to corrosion and staining, low maintenance, and familiar luster make stainless steel an ideal material for many applications where both the strength of steel and corrosion resistance are required. Moreover, stainless steel can be rolled into sheets, plates, bars, wire, and tubing. These can be used in cookware, cutlery, surgical instruments, major appliances, construction material in large buildings, industrial equipment (e.g., in paper mills, chemical plants, water treatment), and storage tanks and tankers for chemicals and food products. The material's corrosion resistance, the ease with which it can be steam-cleaned and sterilized, and the absence of the need for surface coatings have prompted the use of stainless steel in kitchens and food processing plants.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

However, thorium is retained in the body, and it is radioactive, emitting harmful alpha radiation as it decays. Because the suspension offered high image quality and had virtually no immediate side-effects compared to the alternatives available at the time, Thorotrast became widely used after its introduction in 1931. António Egas Moniz contributed to its development. About 2 to 10 million patients worldwide have been treated with Thorotrast.

Diagnostic Medical Sonography Degree Prerequisites: When enrolled in a degree seeking program, most colleges or universities will have a core curriculum that is required before starting ultrasound courses. The core studies are designed to prepare students for the specialized and more technical nature of the degree major. The courses will include some fundamental medical training as well as the required general studies material. Meeting the requirements necessary for entrance into ultrasound technician school can take approximately a year. The typical requirements will include courses such as algebra, physics, anatomy, communications and computers. In addition to the course requirements, it is often mandatory that a good standing GPA be maintained prior to entry into the program. These requirements are standard for most schools, however some may advise that additional requirements be met before accepting students. Prospective ultrasound students are advised to contact ultrasound training schools in their areas to determine available training programs, degree options and the admissions requirements.

It is also applied by emergency personnel to those who have had traumatic head or neck injuries, and can be used to treat chronic medical conditions. Whenever people have a traumatic head or neck injury, they may have a cervical fracture. This makes them at high risk for spinal cord injury, which could be exacerbated by movement of the person and could lead to paralysis or death. A common scenario for this injury would be a person suspected of having whiplash because of a car accident. In order to prevent further injury, such people may have a collar placed by medical professionals until X-rays can be taken to determine if a cervical spine fracture exists. The cervical collar only stabilizes the top seven vertebrae, C1 through C7. (Other immobilizing devices such as a Kendrick Extrication Device or a backboard can be used to stabilize the remainder of the spinal column.) The routine use of a cervical collar by a first aid provider is not recommended. Cervical collars are also used therapeutically to help realign the spinal cord and relieve pain, although they are usually not worn for long periods of time. Another use of the cervical collar is for strains, sprains or whiplash. If pain is persistent, the collar might be required to remain attached to help in the healing process.

A round catheter of 1 French has an external diameter of ​1⁄3 mm, and therefore the diameter of a round catheter in millimetres can be determined by dividing the French size by 3: D (mm) = Fr / 3 or Fr = D (mm) * 3 For example, if the French size is 9, the diameter is 9/3 = 3.0; mm. It is seen that the French unit is fully redundant with the metric system but introduces potential for rounding errors. This metrication problem is further complicated by the mixed use of metric and imperial units in medical professions using catheters. From the basic math equation C = πd, it follows that the catheter's circumference in mm is only slightly (about 4.7%) greater than the French size. An increasing French size corresponds to a larger external diameter. This is contrary to Birmingham gauge, where an increasing gauge corresponds to a smaller diameter needle. The French size is a measure of the outer diameter of a catheter (not internal drainage channel, or inner diameter). So, for example, if a two-way catheter of 20 Fr is compared to a 20 Fr three-way catheter, they both have the same external diameter but the two-way catheter will have a larger drainage channel than the three-way. Three-way catheters accommodate an extra channel for irrigation within a similar external diameter. The French gauge was devised by Joseph-Frédéric-Benoît Charrière, a 19th-century Parisian maker of surgical instruments, who defined the ""diameter times 3"" relationship.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Catheters,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/DefiniteQuantity113576101 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Measure100033615 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/UnitOfMeasurement113583724 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatObsoleteUnitsOfMeasurement | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatUnitsOfLength | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatUnitsOfMeasurement

The most clinical experience has been with electrical stimulation. Neuromodulation, whether electrical or magnetic, employs the body's natural biological response by stimulating nerve cell activity that can influence populations of nerves by releasing transmitters, such as dopamine, or other chemical messengers such as the peptide Substance P, that can modulate the excitability and firing patterns of neural circuits. There may also be more direct electrophysiological effects on neural membranes as the mechanism of action of electrical interaction with neural elements. The end effect is a ""normalization"" of a neural network function from its perturbed state. Presumed mechanisms of action for neurostimulation include depolarizing blockade, stochastic normalization of neural firing, , reduction of neural firing keratosis, and suppression of neural network oscillations. Although the exact mechanisms of neurostimulation are not known, the empirical effectiveness has led to considerable application clinically. Existing and emerging neuromodulation treatments also include application in medication-resistant epilepsy, chronic head pain conditions, and functional therapy ranging from bladder and bowel or respiratory control to improvement of sensory deficits, such as hearing (cochlear implants and auditory brainstem implants) and vision (retinal implants). Technical improvements include a trend toward minimally invasive (or noninvasive) systems; as well as smaller, more sophisticated devices that may have automated feedback control, and conditional compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging.

The second type of IOL, more commonly known as a phakic intraocular lens (PIOL), is a lens which is placed over the existing natural lens and is used in refractive surgery to change the eye's optical power as a treatment for myopia (nearsightedness). IOLs usually consist of a small plastic lens with plastic side struts, called haptics, to hold the lens in place in the capsular bag inside the eye. IOLs were conventionally made of an inflexible material (PMMA), although this has largely been superseded by the use of flexible materials, such as silicone and acrylic glass. Most IOLs fitted today are fixed monofocal lenses matched to distance vision. However, other types are available, such as multifocal IOLs that provide the patient with multiple-focused vision at far and reading distance, and adaptive IOLs that provide the patient with limited visual accommodation. Surgeons annually implant more than 6 million lenses. The procedure can be done under local anesthesia with the patient awake throughout the operation. The use of a flexible IOL enables the lens to be rolled for insertion into the capsule through a very small incision, thus avoiding the need for stitches. This procedure usually takes less than 30 minutes in the hands of an experienced ophthalmologist. The recovery period is about 2–3 weeks. After surgery, patients should avoid strenuous exercise or anything else that significantly increases blood pressure. They should visit their ophthalmologists regularly for several months to monitor the implants. IOL implantation carries several risks associated with eye surgeries, such as infection, loosening of the lens, lens rotation, inflammation and nighttime halos, but a systematic review of studies has determined that the procedure is safer than conventional laser eye treatment.

This standard establishes the requirements for risk management to determine the safety of a medical device by the manufacturer during the product life cycle. Such activity is required by higher level regulation and other quality management system standards such as ISO 13485. Specifically, ISO 14971 is a nine-part standard which first establishes a framework for risk analysis, evaluation, control, and review, and also specifies a procedure for review and monitoring during production and post-production. In 2012, a European harmonized version of this standard was adopted by CEN as EN ISO 14971:2012. This version is harmonized with respect to the three European Directives associated with medical devices Active Implantable Medical Device Directive 90/385/EEC, Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC, and In-vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive 98/79/EC, through the three 'Zed' Annexes (ZA, ZB & ZC). This was done to address the presumed compliance with the 3 Directives that is obtained through notified body certification audits and regulatory submissions that claim compliance to this standard.

In this way, the data can be retrieved and analyzed by independent software. EDF(+) software (browsers, checkers, ...) and example files are freely available. EDF was published in 1992 and stores multichannel data, allowing different sample rates for each signal. Internally it includes a header and one or more data records. The header contains some general information (patient identification, start time...) and technical specs of each signal (calibration, sampling rate, filtering, ...), coded as ASCII characters. The data records contain samples as little-endian 16-bit integers. EDF is a popular format for polysomnography (PSG) recordings. EDF+ was published in 2003 and is largely compatible to EDF: all existing EDF viewers also show EDF+ signals. But EDF+ files also allow coding discontinuous recordings as well as annotations, stimuli and events in UTF-8 format. EDF+ has applications in PSG, electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG), and Sleep scoring.

Typically a catheter is inserted into a large artery (such as the femoral artery) and threaded through the circulatory system to the carotid artery, where a contrast agent is injected. A series of radiographs are taken as the contrast agent spreads through the brain's arterial system, then a second series as it reaches the venous system. Prior to the 1970s the typical technique involved a needle puncture directly into the carotid artery, as depicted in the 1973 horror film The Exorcist, which was replaced by the current method of threading a catheter from a distant artery due to common complications caused by trauma to the artery at the puncture site in the neck (particularly hematomas of the neck, with possible compromission of the airway). For some applications cerebral angiography may yield better images than less invasive methods such as computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography.In addition, cerebral angiography allows certain treatments to be performed immediately, based on its findings. In recent decades, cerebral angiography has so assumed a therapeutic connotation thanks to the elaboration of endovascular therapeutic techniques. Embolization (a minimally invasive surgical technique) over time has played an increasingly significant role in the multimodal treatment of cerebral MAVs, facilitating subsequent microsurgical or radiosurgical treatment. Another type of treatment possible by angiography (if the images reveal an aneurysm) is the introduction of metal coils through the catheter already in place and maneuvered to the site of aneurysm; over time these coils encourage formation of connective tissue at the site, strengthening the vessel walls. In some jurisdictions, cerebral angiography is required to confirm brain death. Prior to the advent of modern neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and CT in the mid-1970s, cerebral angiographies were frequently employed as a tool to infer the existence and location of certain kinds of lesions and hematomas by looking for secondary vascular displacement caused by the mass effect related to these medical conditions. This use of angiography as an indirect assessment tool is nowadays obsolete as modern non-invasive diagnostic methods are available to image many kinds of primary intracranial abnormalities directly. It is still widely used however for evaluating various types of vascular pathologies within the skull.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroimaging,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

In the United States, lift chairs qualify as Durable Medical Equipment under Medicare Part B. In a February 1989 report released by the Inspector General of the US Department of Health and Human Services, it was found that: lift chairs might not possibly meet Medicare's requirements for Durable Medical Equipment (DME) and lift chair claims need to be re-regulated. The report was stimulated by an increase in lift chair claims between 1984 and 1985 from 200,000 to 700,000. A New York Times article stated that aggressive TV ads were pushing consumers to inquire about lift chairs and, once consumers called in, a form was sent to them for their physicians to sign. Some companies would ship lift chairs before receiving a physician's signature; therefore, forcing the physicians to sign or else their patient will be forced to pay for the chair. Medicare may only cover the cost of the lift-mechanism rather than the entire chair. Before Medicare can be considered for covering the cost, patients will need to have a visit with their physician to discuss the need for this particular equipment. The DME provider will then request a prescription and a certificate of medical necessity (CMN). The CMN typical involves five questions that the physician needs to answer. Typically, the questions are (1) Does the patient have severe arthritis, (2) Does the patient have a neuromuscular disease, (3) Is the patient incapable of getting up from a regular chair in their home, (4) Can the patient walk once standing, and (5) Have all other therapeutic measures been taken? If any of the questions are answered ""NO"", it may likely result in a denial of the claim. Typically, DME providers require full payment for the lift chair and will offer reimbursement upon approval from Medicare.

The technical development of the Minusheet perfusion culture system was driven by the idea to create under in vitro conditions an environment resembling as near as possible the situation of specialized tissues found within the organism. Basis of this invention is therefore individually selected biomaterials for optimal cell adhesion mounted in Minusheet tissue carriers. Moreover, to always offer fresh nutrition including respiratory gas and to simulate a tissue-specific fluid environment, the tissue carriers can be inserted into compatible perfusion culture containers. As a result, a variety of publications illustrates that tissues generated by this innovative approach exhibit an excellent and stable quality. Thus, on the one hand the system provides a highly adaptable basis for the culture of adherent cells and the generation of specialized tissues.

Marketed as Magnevist by Bayer AG, it was the first intravenous contrast agent to become available for clinical use, and is in widespread use around the world. Magnevist is a clear, colorless to slightly yellow solution containing 0.5 mmol gadopentetate dimeglumine/mL(equivalent to 469.01 mg/mL of gadopentetate dimeglumine).

The MLC has improved rapidly since its inception and the first use of leaves to shape structures in 1965  to modern day operation and use. MLCs are now widely used and have become an integral part of any radiotherapy department. MLCs were primarily used for conformal radiotherapy, and have allowed the cost-effective implementation of conformal treatment with significant time saving, and also have been adapted for use for IMRT treatments. For conformal radiotherapy the MLC allows conformal shaping of the beam to match the borders of the target tumour. For intensity modulated treatments the leaves of a MLC can be moved across the field to create IMRT distributions (MLCs really provide a fluence modulation rather than intensity modulation). The MLC is an important tool for radiation therapy dose delivery. It was originally used as a surrogate for alloy block field shaping and is now widely used for IMRT. As with any tool used in radiotherapy the MLC must undergo commissioning and quality assurance. Additional commissioning measurements are completed to model a MLC for treatment planning.

It is a full-torso brace that extends from the pelvis to the base of the skull. It was originally designed by Blount and Schmidt in 1946 for postoperative care when surgery required long periods of immobilization. Milwaukee braces are often custom-made over a mold of the patient's torso, but in some cases, it can be made from prefabricated parts. Three bars—two posterior and one anterior—are attached to a pelvic girdle made of leather or plastic, as well as a neck ring. The ring has an anterior throat mold and two posterior occipital pads, which fit behind the patient's head. Lateral pads are strapped to the bars; adjustment of these straps holds the spine in alignment. This brace is normally used with growing adolescents to hold a 25° to 40° advancing curve. The brace is intended to minimize the progression to an acceptable level, not to correct the curvature. If, despite the brace, curve progression beyond 40-50 degrees is evident, surgery may be required. The Milwaukee brace is often prescribed to be worn 23 hours a day until the patient reaches skeletal maturity and growth ceases. A related brace is the Boston brace (underarm brace, also known as a thoraco-lumbo-sacral orthosis, or TLSO), which is more commonly used for scoliosis. That brace does not have a neck ring and is more easily concealed under clothing, thus more acceptable to patients.

The two devices had separate power sources, but the meter could not function on its own as it displayed the information on the screen of the insulin pump. Unlike the Animas Ping which has a locking feature that is undone by pressing both the up and down arrow buttons, the Deltec Cozmo had a number locking feature. The purpose of this feature was somewhat defeated by pump trainers encouraging the use of 14 as the code number. The Deltec Cozmo also used a different scrolling mechanism than the Animas Ping. On the Ping pump holding down the up or down button causes a change in one number then increments by five and on the Ping meter the numbers slowly climb to 5 then abruptly change speed, going from 5 to 110 in the same time it took to go from 0-5; on the Cozmo the scrolling speed slowly accelerated the longer the button was held down. This allowed the pumper to get to high values relatively fast and then still get to the exact value they wanted. While it was still being sold, the Cozmo was marketed heavily towards young people, and included many features that made it easy for teenagers and preteens to use. It came in a variety of neon colors, including ice blue and purple, and allowed users to ""name"" their pumps.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_pumps,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MechanicalDevice103736970 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Mechanism103738472 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Pump104021798 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalPumps

It is commonly used by eye care professionals during an eye examination, and contains different lenses used for refraction of the eye during sight testing, to measure an individual's refractive error and determine his or her eyeglass prescription. It also is used to measure the patients' phorias and ductions, which are characteristics of binocularity. Typically, the patient sits behind the phoropter, and looks through it at an eye chart placed at optical infinity (20 feet or 6 metres), then at near (16 inches or 40 centimetres) for individuals needing reading glasses. The eye care professional then changes lenses and other settings, while asking the patient for subjective feedback on which settings gave the best vision. The patient's habitual prescription or an automated refractor may be used to provide initial settings for the phoropter. Sometimes a retinoscope is used through the phoropter to measure the vision without the patient having to speak, which is useful for infants and people who don't speak the language of the practitioner. Phoropters can also measure Heterophorias (natural resting position of the eyes), accommodative amplitudes, accommodative leads/lags, accommodative posture, horizontal and vertical vergences, and more. The major components of the phoropter are the battery of spherical and cylindrical lenses, auxiliary devices such as Maddox rods, filtered lenses, prisms, and the JCC (Jackson Cross-Cylinder) used for astigmatism measurement. The prismatic lenses are used to analyze binocular vision and treat orthoptic problems. From the measurements taken, the specialist will write an eyeglass prescription that contains at least 3 numerical specifications for each eye: sphere, cylinder, and axis, as well as pupillary distance (distance between eyes), and, rarely, prism for one or both eyes. The lenses within a phoropter refract light in order to focus images on the patient's retina. The optical power of these lenses is measured in 0.25 diopter increments. By changing these lenses, the examiner is able to determine the spherical power, cylindrical power, and cylindrical axis necessary to correct a person's refractive error. The presence of cylindrical power indicates the presence of astigmatism, which has an axis measured from 0 to 180 degrees away from being aligned horizontally. Phoropters are made with either plus or minus cylinders. Traditionally, ophthalmologists and orthoptists use plus cylinder phoropters and optometrists use minus cylinder phoropters. One can mathematically convert figures obtained from either type of phoropter to the other.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Ophthalmic_equipment,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrument103574816 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MeasuringInstrument103733925 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/OpticalDevice103851341 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMeasuringInstruments | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatOpticalDevices

The examiner uses a retinoscope to shine light into the patient's eye and observes the reflection (reflex) off the patient's retina. While moving the streak or spot of light across the pupil the examiner observes the relative movement of the reflex or manually places lenses over the eye (using a trial frame and trial lenses) to ""neutralize"" the reflex. Static retinoscopy is a type of retinoscopy used in determining a patient's refractive error. It relies on Foucault knife-edge test, which states that the examiner should simulate optical infinity to obtain the correct refractive power. Hence, a power corresponding to the working distance is subtracted from the gross retinoscopy value to give the patient's refractive condition, the working distance lens being one which has a focal length of the examiner's distance from the patient (e.g. +1.50 dioptre lens for a 67 cm working distance). Myopes display an ""against"" reflex, which means that the direction of movement of light observed from the retina is a different direction to that in which the light beam is swept. Hyperopes, on the other hand, display a ""with"" movement, which means that the direction of movement of light observed from the retina is the same as that in which the light beam is swept. Static retinoscopy is performed when the patient has relaxed accommodative status. This can be obtained by the patient viewing a distance target or by the use of cycloplegic drugs (where, for example, a child's lack of reliable fixation of the target can lead to fluctuations in accommodation and thus the results obtained). Dynamic retinoscopy is performed when the patient has active accommodation from viewing a near target. Retinoscopy is particularly useful in prescribing corrective lenses for patients who are unable to undergo a subjective refraction that requires a judgement and response from the patient (such as children or those with severe intellectual disabilities or communication problems). In most tests however, it is used as a basis for further refinement by subjective refraction. It is also used to evaluate accommodative ability of the eye and detect latent hyperopia.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Ophthalmic_equipment,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatEyeProcedures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

The company asserted in 1999 that its sole intended use was for health care purposes. Hitachi had a conflict with its U.S. distributor in 2000 and briefly stopped selling the device until it reached a new deal with distributor Vibratex. The Magic Wand sold out after being featured in a 2002 episode of Sex and the City. Hitachi ceased production of the device in 2013 because of concerns about having the company name attached to a sex toy. Vibratex persuaded the company to continue manufacturing it under the name ""Original Magic Wand"", omitting the Hitachi name. In 2014, the company used the name ""Magic Wand Original"". Academics have researched its use for treatment of female sexual arousal disorder and chronic anorgasmia—a sexual dysfunction in which a person cannot achieve orgasm.

This type of emulsion was named after S.U. Pickering, who described the phenomenon in 1907, although the effect was first recognized by Walter Ramsden in 1903. If oil and water are mixed and small oil droplets are formed and dispersed throughout the water, eventually the droplets will coalesce to decrease the amount of energy in the system. However, if solid particles are added to the mixture, they will bind to the surface of the interface and prevent the droplets from coalescing, making the emulsion more stable. Properties such as hydrophobicity, shape, and size of the particle can have an effect on the stability of the emulsion. The particle’s contact angle to the surface of the droplet is a characteristic of the hydrophobicity. If the contact angle of the particle to the interface is low, the particle will be mostly wetted by the droplet and therefore will not be likely to prevent coalescence of the droplets. Particles that are partially hydrophobic (i.e. contact angle of approximately 90°) are better stabilizers because they are partially wettable by both liquids and therefore bind better to the surface of the droplets. The stabilization energy is given by where r is the particle radius,  is the interfacial tension, and  is the contact angle. When the contact angle is approximately 90°, the energy required to stabilize the system is at its minimum.Generally, the phase that preferentially wets the particle will be the continuous phase in the emulsion system. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the stability of the Pickering emulsions can be improved by the use of amphiphilic ""Janus particles"", namely particles that have one hydrophobic and one hydrophilic side, due to the higher adsorption energy of the particles at the liquid-liquid interface. This is evident when observing emulsion stabilization using polyelectrolytes. Homogenised milk is an example of a Pickering-stabilized emulsion. Casein (protein) units are adsorbed at the surface of milk fat globules and act as a surfactant. The casein replaces the milkfat globule membrane, which is damaged during homogenisation. It is possible to use latex particles for Pickering stabilization and then fuse these particles to form a permeable shell or capsule, called a colloidosome. Moreover, Pickering emulsion droplets are also suitable templates for micro-encapsulation and the formation of closed, non-permeable capsules. This form of encapsulation can also be applied to water-in-water emulsions (dispersions of phase-separated aqueous polymer solutions), and can also be reversible.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Form106290637 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LanguageUnit106284225 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Mixture114586258 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatChemicalMixtures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDosageForms | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Word106286395

This change in conformation is a response to changes in transmembrane voltage. When ion channels are in a 'closed' (non-conducting) state, they are impermeable to ions and do not conduct electrical current. When ion channels are in their open state, they conduct electrical current by allowing specific types of ions to pass through them, and thus, across the plasma membrane of the cell. Gating is the process by which an ion channel transitions between its open and closed states. A variety of cellular changes can trigger gating, depending on the ion channel, including changes in voltage across the cell membrane (voltage-gated ion channels), chemicals interacting with the ion channel (ligand-gated ion channels), changes in temperature, stretching or deformation of the cell membrane, addition of a phosphate group to the ion channel (phosphorylation), and interaction with other molecules in the cell (e.g., G proteins). The rate at which any of these gating processes occurs in response to these triggers are known as the kinetics of gating. Some drugs and many ion channel toxins act as 'gating modifiers' of voltage-gated ion channels by changing the kinetics of gating. The voltage-gated ion channels of the action potential are often described as having four gating processes: activation, deactivation, inactivation, and reactivation (also called 'recovery from inactivation'). Activation is the process of opening the activation gate, which occurs in response to the voltage inside the cell membrane (the membrane potential) becoming more positive with respect to the outside of the cell (depolarization), and 'deactivation' is the opposite process of the activation gate closing in response to the inside of the membrane becoming more negative (repolarization). 'Inactivation' is the closing of the inactivation gate, and occurs in response to the voltage inside the membrane becoming more positive, but more slowly than activation. 'Reactivation' is the opposite of inactivation, and is the process of reopening the inactivation gate. These voltage-dependent changes in function are critical for a large number of processes in excitable and nonexcitable cells.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Channel106259898 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Communication106252138 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Transmission106251781 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatIonChannels | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

The FDA regulate silicones used in food contact under the auspices of the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition (CFSAN) and for use in pharmaceuticals under the auspices of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). Medical grade silicones are generally grouped into three categories: non implantable, short term implantable, and long-term implantable. Materials approved as Class V and VI can be considered medical grade. Most medical grade silicones are at least Class VI certified. Silicone suppliers and some silicone prototyping companies provide guidelines for material use.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Chemical114806838 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Compound114818238 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Elastomer114840583 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Polymer114994328 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Silicone115040493 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Siloxane115040899 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatElastomers | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSilicones | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSiloxanes

These measurements reflect blood volume changes, and can indirectly indicate the presence or absence of venous thrombosis. This procedure provides an alternative to venography, which is invasive and requires a great deal of skill to execute adequately and interpret accurately. For the chest, the technique was developed by NASA to measure the split second impedance changes within the chest, as the heart beats, to calculate both cardiac output and lung water content. This technique has progressed clinically (often now called BioZ, i.e. biologic impedance, as promoted by the leading manufacturer in the US) and allows low cost, non-invasive estimations of cardiac output and total peripheral resistance, using only 4 skin electrodes, oscillometric blood pressure measurement and lung water volumes with minimal removal of clothing in physician offices having the needed equipment. For leg veins, the test measures blood volume in the lower leg due to temporary venous obstruction. This is accomplished by inflating a pneumatic cuff around the thigh to sufficient pressure to cut off venous flow but not arterial flow, causing the venous blood pressure to rise until it equals the pressure under the cuff. When the cuff is released there is a rapid venous runoff and a prompt return to the resting blood volume. Venous thrombosis will alter the normal response to temporary venous obstruction in a highly characteristic way, causing a delay in emptying of the venous system after the release of the tourniquet. The increase in blood volume after cuff inflation is also usually diminished.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Experiment105798043 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/HigherCognitiveProcess105770664 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Inquiry105797597 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Measurement100996969 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ProblemSolving105796750 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Process105701363 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thinking105770926 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Trial105799212 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatImpedanceMeasurements | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTests | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatVascularProcedures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

Medically, it occurs mostly in context of the complications from breast implants and artificial joint prosthetics. The occurrence of capsular contraction follows the formation of capsules of tightly-woven collagen fibers, created by the immune response to the presence of foreign objects surgically installed to the human body, e.g. breast implants, artificial pacemakers, orthopedic prostheses; biological protection by isolation and toleration. Capsular contracture occurs when the collagen-fiber capsule shrinks, tightens and compresses the breast implant, much like the collapse of a bubble gum bubble. It is a medical complication that can be painful and discomforting, and might distort the aesthetics of the breast implant and the breast. Although the cause of capsular contracture is unknown, factors common to its incidence include bacterial contamination, rupture of the breast-implant shell, leakage of the silicone-gel filling, and hematoma. Moreover, because capsular contracture is a consequence of the immune system defending the patient's bodily integrity and health, it might reoccur, even after the requisite corrective surgery for the initial incidence. The degree of an incidence of capsular contracture is graded using the four-grade Baker scale: 
* Grade I — the breast is normally soft and appears natural in size and shape 
* Grade II — the breast is a little firm, but appears normal 
* Grade III — the breast is firm and appears abnormal 
* Grade IV — the breast is hard, painful to the touch, and appears abnormal The surgical implantation methods that have reduced capsular contracture include submuscular breast implant placement, using either textured or polyurethane-coated implants, limited handling of the implants, minimal contact with the chest wall skin before their insertions, and irrigating the surgical sites with triple-antibiotic solutions. The use of textured implants may increase the risk of cancer. The correction of capsular contracture might require the surgical removal (release) of the capsule, or the removal, and possible replacement, of the breast implant, itself. Closed capsulotomy (disrupting the capsule via external manipulation), a once-common maneuver for treating hard capsules, was discontinued because it might rupture the breast implant. Non-surgical methods of treating capsules include massage, external ultrasound, treatment with leukotriene pathway inhibitors (e.g. Accolate, Singulair), and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy. The Mentor Worldwide LLC corporation, one of the three, U.S. FDA-approved breast-implant device manufacturers, conducted a study of the medical complications suffered by breast implantation surgery patients. In March 2000, at a Food and Drug Administration presentation, the Mentor report indicated that 43 per cent of patients with saline breast implants reported medical complications occurring within three years of the surgery; moreover, 10 per cent of that percentage group complained of capsular contracture.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Corrective103111899 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Implant103563710 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Prosthesis104013729 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatImplants

The two main types of capsules are: 
* Hard-shelled capsules, which contain dry, powdered ingredients or miniature pellets made by e.g. processes of extrusion or . These are made in two halves: a smaller-diameter “body” that is filled and then sealed using a larger-diameter “cap”. 
* Soft-shelled capsules, primarily used for oils and for active ingredients that are dissolved or suspended in oil. Both of these classes of capsules are made from aqueous solutions of gelling agents, such as animal protein (mainly gelatin) or plant polysaccharides or their derivatives (such as carrageenans and modified forms of starch and cellulose). Other ingredients can be added to the gelling agent solution including plasticizers such as glycerin or sorbitol to decrease the capsule's hardness, coloring agents, preservatives, disintegrants, lubricants and surface treatment. Since their inception, capsules have been viewed by consumers as the most efficient method of taking medication. For this reason, producers of drugs such as OTC analgesics wanting to emphasize the strength of their product developed the “caplet”, a portmanteau of “capsule-shaped tablet”, in order to tie this positive association to more efficiently-produced tablet pills, as well as being an easier-to-swallow shape than the usual disk-shaped tablet.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Container103094503 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatContainers | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDrugDeliveryDevices

For the exterior of the cell, typical values of membrane potential, normally given in units of millivolts and denoted as mV, range from –40 mV to –80 mV. All animal cells are surrounded by a membrane composed of a lipid bilayer with proteins embedded in it. The membrane serves as both an insulator and a diffusion barrier to the movement of ions. Transmembrane proteins, also known as ion transporter or ion pump proteins, actively push ions across the membrane and establish concentration gradients across the membrane, and ion channels allow ions to move across the membrane down those concentration gradients. Ion pumps and ion channels are electrically equivalent to a set of batteries and resistors inserted in the membrane, and therefore create a voltage between the two sides of the membrane. Almost all plasma membranes have an electrical potential across them, with the inside usually negative with respect to the outside. The membrane potential has two basic functions. First, it allows a cell to function as a battery, providing power to operate a variety of ""molecular devices"" embedded in the membrane. Second, in electrically excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells, it is used for transmitting signals between different parts of a cell. Signals are generated by opening or closing of ion channels at one point in the membrane, producing a local change in the membrane potential. This change in the electric field can be quickly affected by either adjacent or more distant ion channels in the membrane. Those ion channels can then open or close as a result of the potential change, reproducing the signal. In non-excitable cells, and in excitable cells in their baseline states, the membrane potential is held at a relatively stable value, called the resting potential. For neurons, typical values of the resting potential range from –70 to –80 millivolts; that is, the interior of a cell has a negative baseline voltage of a bit less than one-tenth of a volt. The opening and closing of ion channels can induce a departure from the resting potential. This is called a depolarization if the interior voltage becomes less negative (say from –70 mV to –60 mV), or a hyperpolarization if the interior voltage becomes more negative (say from –70 mV to –80 mV). In excitable cells, a sufficiently large depolarization can evoke an action potential, in which the membrane potential changes rapidly and significantly for a short time (on the order of 1 to 100 milliseconds), often reversing its polarity. Action potentials are generated by the activation of certain voltage-gated ion channels. In neurons, the factors that influence the membrane potential are diverse. They include numerous types of ion channels, some of which are chemically gated and some of which are voltage-gated. Because voltage-gated ion channels are controlled by the membrane potential, while the membrane potential itself is influenced by these same ion channels, feedback loops that allow for complex temporal dynamics arise, including oscillations and regenerative events such as action potentials.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/AmorphousShape113867492 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Attribute100024264 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cell102991711 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Compartment103080309 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Location100027167 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Shape100027807 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Space113910384 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCells | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatContractileCells | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoGeoEntity | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

It has an additional use in gastric variceal obliteration as a dilutant that does not affect polymerization of cyanoacrylate. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the use of Lipiodol as a therapeutic agent in the management of unexplained infertility, using a procedure called Lipiodol flushing. There have been a small number of studies that suggest that flushing the media through the tubes gives a short-term rise in fecundity in patients with unexplained infertility. A systematic review has suggested a significant increase in fertility, especially in those women who have endometriosis when using Lipiodol flushing. Historically Lipiodol was often used as a contrast medium at hysterosalpingography (HSG: a procedure to determine tubal patency, used in the investigation of subfertility). It became less commonly utilized in the 1960s to 1980s because the more modern water-soluble media give images that are easier to interpret. There is also an important safety issue with Lipiodol in that intravasation (leakage) of the fluid into the venous system has caused complications in the past. Ethiodized oil is composed of iodine combined with ethyl esters of fatty acids of poppyseed oil, primarily as ethyl monoiodostearate and ethyl diiodostearate. The precise structure is not known. Lipiodol was first synthesized by Marcel Guerbet in the Paris School of Pharmacy in 1901. Historically, Lipiodol was the first iodinated contrast agent (used for myelography by two French physicians, Jacques Forestier and Jean Sicard in 1921).

Wheelchair lifts can be installed in homes or businesses and are often added to both private and public vehicles in order to meet accessibility requirements laid out by disability acts. These mobility devices are often installed in homes as an alternative to a stair lift, which only transport a passenger and not his/her wheelchair or mobility scooter. In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) required that all new mass transit vehicles placed into service after July 1, 1993, be accessible to persons in wheelchairs, and until the 2000s, this requirement was most commonly met by the inclusion of a wheelchair lift. In 1993, there were 29,033 transit buses in the U.S. equipped with wheelchair lifts or ramps, representing 52 percent of all U.S. transit buses. By 2001, this figure had grown to 58,785 buses (although the percentage that were equipped with lifts, as opposed to ramps, is unknown). Low-floor transit vehicles (buses, streetcars, light rail cars) – fitted with ramps or bridge plates rather than lifts – later began to become more common than lifts for heavy-duty transit vehicles, while lifts continue to be used in paratransit vehicles. A number of legal regimes in various countries regulate the use of wheelchair lifts, setting forth standards for the devices and requiring certain kinds of businesses to make parking lots accessible to vehicles bearing the devices. In some instances, accessibility standards have been achieved in legal settlements. For example, in the 2005 case of Dilworth, et al. v. City of Detroit, NO. 2:04- cv-73152 (E.D. Mich. 2005), the defendant city conceded that the Americans With Disabilities Act and its supporting legislation required the city ""to maintain the wheelchair lifts on its buses in operative condition; promptly repair wheelchair lifts if they are damaged or out of order; establish a system of regular and frequent maintenance checks of wheelchair lifts; remove a vehicle from service if the lift is inoperative (with limited exceptions); provide alternative transportation when the lift doesn't work and the next accessible bus is more than 30 minutes away."" While some wheelchair-accessible vans use a powered lift to assist the occupant in boarding, a wheelchair ramp is usually less expensive for this purpose and is often installed on minivans. Full-size vans require the use of a platform lift. There are two types of platform lifts installed on wheelchair-accessible vans: single-arm and dual-arm. Single-arm wheelchair lifts are only used in side-entry applications. They take up less interior space and leave the passenger entry open; however, they have less lifting capacity than dual-arm lifts. Most dual-arm wheelchair lifts have a lift capacity up to 800 pounds. These lifts consume more interior space and block the side entry and, for these reasons, are often mounted in the back of the vehicle for rear-entry applications. As mandated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), wheelchair-accessible vans with wheelchair lifts are equipped with a safety lift interlock. Designed to prevent operation of the wheelchair van or wheelchair lift in unsafe situations, the safety interlock will sound an alarm if an unsafe condition exists (e.g., the vehicle attempts to move while the lift is deployed) or prevent the vehicle from shifting into drive while the wheelchair lift is in operation. In 2002, innovations allowed the development of wheelchair lifts that assist people in entering truck cabs, so that they may drive or operate heavy equipment. Wheelchair lifts can also be used to move an unoccupied scooter into a vehicle.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Mobility_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Chair103001627 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Furnishing103405265 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Furniture103405725 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Seat104161981 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Wheelchair104576002 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatWheelchairs

In conjunction with the Cambridge Veterinary School, proof of concept studies have indicated that the device is sensitive enough to noninvasively pick up respiratory movements in domestic animals (cats and dogs). A totally “non-invasive” technique using structured light to measure pulmonary function was developed as long ago as the mid-1980s by a London group at the Royal Brompton Hospital working in close association with IBM (1-4). The technique used the distortion with movement of a structured pattern of light to calculate a volume or change in volume of a textured surface. At that time structured light pattern was shone on to the anterior chest and abdominal wall surfaces, and movie camera film footage was taken and sent to IBM for processing. The digital information was used to compute automatically the volume of the trunk and the position of any point on its surface and its cross-sectional shape at any level. The group found that linear dimensions could be calculated to within 0.5mm and a cross-sectional area within 5% and volume within 3-7%. The group suggested that non-invasive technique measurements were of sufficient accuracy to be tried in clinical practice. However, probably due to technology limitations, data processing and storage, the methodology was never commercialised. Independently the Royal Brompton group of the 1980s, a Cambridge (UK) consortium of clinicians and engineers developed a system in 2009 that has revisited structure light pattern as a noninvasive method for collecting accurate representations of chest and abdominal wall movement. The methodology has several advantages: there are no fluorescent markers required to define chest or abdominal surface and the hardware can be minimalized to 2 digital cameras and a digital projector when imaging the anterior surface of the body. The projector shines a grid of black and white squares from superior iliac crest to clavicle; the subject can wear a plain t-shirt of any colour. The 2 digital cameras image the grid on chest and abdomen and the software extracts 2 sets of 2D image positions of the grid points and stereo vision is used to reconstruct these grid points to form a 3D representation of the chest and abdominal wall surface. The group has tried anything from one grid point to 2000 and is current working on roughly 200 to 300. The thoracic volume is calculated from the volume beneath the reconstructed virtual surface and can be plotted in real time. Calibration is internal: the relative position of cameras and shape of the subject is auto-calibrated at reconstruction time; and externally by placing an object of reference size in front of the cameras. This can be a sheet of paper of known size and potentially has now been transferred to projected points within the grid itself. The group have now collected data on up to 70 adults and 5 children and have also collected data from small mammals. They have compared simultaneous measurements of tidal breathing followed by full inspiration and force expiration by Pneumatac and SLP. The Pneumatac data was obtained using a laptop based spirometer and exported for analysis using J-scope software. Extremely good correlations have been obtained from tidal breaching and forced expiration manoeuvres. Tidal breathing correlations have shown to be 0.99 for individual data sets and for n=70 the mean correlation was 0.92 at an SD of 0.04. For forced expiration the correlation was shown to be 0.98, n=70 mean correlation was 0.98 with an SD of 0.12. For forced expirations inspiratory manoeuvres correlation coefficients for peak flow were r² 0.84, FEV1 0.95, FEF75 0.76 and FEF50 0.69.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Respiratory_system_imaging,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Experiment105798043 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/HigherCognitiveProcess105770664 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Inquiry105797597 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ProblemSolving105796750 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Process105701363 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thinking105770926 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Trial105799212 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTests

R.H. Mole proposed the term “abscopal” (‘ab’ - away from, ‘scopus’ - target) in 1953 to refer to effects of ionizing radiation “at a distance from the irradiated volume but within the same organism.” Initially associated with single-tumor, localized radiation therapy, the term “abscopal effect” has also come to encompass other types of localized treatments such as electroporation and intra-tumoral injection of therapeutics. However, the term should only be used when truly local treatments result in systemic effects. For instance, chemotherapeutics commonly circulate through the blood stream and therefore exclude the possibility of any abscopal response. The mediators of the abscopal effect of radiotherapy were unknown for decades. In 2004, it was postulated for the first time that the immune system might be responsible for these “off-target” anti-tumor effects. Various studies in animal models of melanoma, mammary, and colorectal tumors have substantiated this hypothesis. Furthermore, immune-mediated abscopal effects were also described in patients with metastatic cancer. Whereas these reports were extremely rare throughout the 20th century, the clinical use of immune checkpoint blocking antibodies such as ipilimumab or pembrolizumab has greatly increased the number of abscopally responding patients in selected groups of patients such as those with metastatic melanoma.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiation_therapy,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Care100654885 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Treatment100658082 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCancerTreatments | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTreatments | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Work100575741 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

Fusion of a deuterium and a tritium atom (D + T) results in the formation of a He-4 ion and a neutron with a kinetic energy of approximately 14.1 MeV. Neutron generators have applications in medicine, security, and materials analysis. The basic concept was first developed by Ernest Rutherford's team in the Cavendish Laboratory in the early 1930s. Using a linear accelerator driven by a Cockcroft–Walton generator, Mark Oliphant led an experiment that fired deuterium ions into a deuterium-infused metal foil and noticed that a small number of these particles gave off alpha particles. This was the first demonstration of nuclear fusion, as well as the first discovery of Helium-3 and tritium, created in these reactions. The introduction of new power sources has continually shrunk the size of these machines, from Oliphant's that filled the corner of the lab, to modern machines that are highly portable. Thousands of such small, relatively inexpensive systems have been built over the past five decades. While neutron generators do produce fusion reactions, the number of accelerated ions that cause these reactions is very low. It can be easily demonstrated that the energy released by these reactions is many times lower than the energy needed to accelerate the ions, so there is no possibility of these machines being used to produce net fusion power. A related concept, colliding beam fusion, attempts to address this issue using two accelerators firing at each other.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiation_therapy,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Beginning108507558 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Conduit103089014 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Location100027167 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Passage103895293 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Point108620061 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Tube104493505 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Way104564698 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatGas-filledTubes | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatNeutronSources | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoGeoEntity | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity
