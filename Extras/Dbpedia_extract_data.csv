First developed and described at Mayo Clinic by Muthupillai et al. in 1995, MRE has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive diagnostic tool, namely as an alternative to biopsy and serum tests for staging liver fibrosis. Diseased tissue (e.g. a breast tumor) is often stiffer than the surrounding normal (fibroglandular) tissue, providing motivation to assess tissue stiffness. This principle of operation is the basis for the longstanding practice of palpation, which, however, is limited (except at surgery) to superficial organs and pathologies, and by its subjective, qualitative nature, depending on the skill and touch sensitivity of the practitioner. Conventional imaging techniques of CT, MRI, US, and nuclear medicine are unable to offer any insight on the elastic modulus of soft tissue. MRE, as a quantitative method of assessing tissue stiffness, provides reliable insight to visualize a variety of disease processes which affect tissue stiffness in the liver, brain, heart, pancreas, kidney, spleen, breast, uterus, prostate, and skeletal muscle. MRE is conducted in three steps: first, a mechanical vibrator is used on the surface of the patient's body to generate shear waves that travel into the patient's deeper tissues; second, an MRI acquisition sequence measures the propagation and velocity of the waves; and finally this information is processed by an inversion algorithm to quantitatively infer and map tissue stiffness in 3-D. This stiffness map is called an elastogram, and is the final output of MRE, along with conventional 3-D MRI images as shown on the right.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Magnetic_resonance_imaging | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_imaging,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/TopicalConcept

In clinical studies the iKnife has shown impressive diagnostic accuracy - identifying benign gynaecological tissue from ovarian cancer (97.4% sensitivity, 100% specificity), breast tumour from normal breast tissue (90.9% sensitivity, 98.8% specificity) and recognises histological features of poor prognostic outcome in colorectal carcinoma. Furthermore, the technology behind iKnife - rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry (REIMS) - can identify Candida yeasts down to species level.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Surgical_instruments,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Weapon

Medical thermology is sometimes referred to as medical infrared imaging or tele-thermology and utilizes thermographic cameras. According to the American Academy of Thermology, Medical Thermology practitioners are licensed health care practitioners who utilize IR imaging in consistent with medically established paradigms of care. Non-medically licensed alternative practitioners who are not held to the same standard may offer thermography services but that should not be confused with the field of medical thermology. Restated, medical thermology is the use of infrared (IR) imaging to assess skin temperature as an extension of the clinician's physical exam to aid in the formation of a medical diagnosis or treatment plan. Medical Thermology does not condone those who purport that ""Thermography"" can find disease by looking for areas of the body that have abnormal heat or irregular blood flow. IR imaging simply does not have the ability to assess temperature beyond the surface of the skin. Thermography is a physiologic study and is not a replacement for structural studies such as X-Ray, MRI, or Mammography. As a physiologic study, however, medical thermology has many health-related indications. The American Academy of Thermology (AAT) (www.aathermology.org) has published internationally peer-reviewed guidelines for neuro-musculoskeletal (MSK), breast, veterinary, and oral-systemic disease. Examples of neuro-musculoskeletal indications for medical thermology include Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD), Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), Dysautonomia, Migraine, Fibromyalgia (and other weather-sensitive pain syndromes), thoracic outlet syndrome, and vaso-motor migraine/headaches such as Barre-Lieou syndrome. This is especially true when used to monitor the results of a cold stress (cold presser) test. While there are several clinical studies showing the effectiveness of thermography in detecting temperature abnormalities of breast skin, breast thermography is only approved as an adjunct modality only for breast disease and/or cancer. In that regard it is a breast risk health assessment only. A summary of some of the clinical trials for breast thermography is available in this white paper from UE LifeSciences pdf. Veterinary thermography indications include, but are not limited to, assessment of shoring, limb inflammation, and sweating disorders. When properly used, a commonly known oral-systemic indication for IR imaging is temperature measurement for fever screening. While there are several other oral-systemic indications out lined in the American Academy of Thermology's Oral -Systemic Guidelines. Whole body studies are not performed for medical purposes. Telethermography systems are regulated as a medical device under 21 CFR 884.2980.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Breast_imaging | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_imaging,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

A growing number of dyes are used for PALM, STORM and related techniques, both organic fluorophores and fluorescent proteins. Some are compatible with live cell imaging, others allow faster acquisition or denser labeling. The choice of a particular fluorophore ultimately depends on the application and on its underlying photophysical properties.

Modeled after an ice-pick, it consisted simply of a pointed shaft. It was passed through the tear duct under the eyelid and against the top of the eyesocket. A mallet was used to drive the instrument through the thin layer of bone and into the brain along the plane of the bridge of the nose, to a depth of 5 cm. Due to incidents of breakage, a stronger but essentially identical instrument called an orbitoclast was later used.

When a presynaptic neuron is excited, it releases a neurotransmitter from vesicles into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter then binds to receptors located on the postsynaptic neuron. If these receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, a resulting conformational change opens the ion channels, which leads to a flow of ions across the cell membrane. This, in turn, results in either a depolarization, for an excitatory receptor response, or a hyperpolarization, for an inhibitory response. These receptor proteins are typically composed of at least two different domains: a transmembrane domain which includes the ion pore, and an extracellular domain which includes the ligand binding location (an allosteric binding site). This modularity has enabled a 'divide and conquer' approach to finding the structure of the proteins (crystallising each domain separately). The function of such receptors located at synapses is to convert the chemical signal of presynaptically released neurotransmitter directly and very quickly into a postsynaptic electrical signal. Many LICs are additionally modulated by allosteric ligands, by channel blockers, ions, or the membrane potential. LICs are classified into three superfamilies which lack evolutionary relationship: cys-loop receptors, ionotropic glutamate receptors and ATP-gated channels.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Channel106259898 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Chemical114806838 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Communication106252138 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Compound114818238 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Macromolecule114944888 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Molecule114682133 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/OrganicCompound114727670 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Protein114728724 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thing100002452 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Transmission106251781 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Unit109465459 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatIonChannels | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatProteins | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Band | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Biomolecule | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Protein | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q206229 | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8054

Imaging techniques in X-ray, MRI, and ultrasound diagnostics yield a great deal of information that the radiologist or other medical professional has to analyze and evaluate comprehensively in a short time. CAD systems process digital images for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases, in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professional. CAD also has potential future applications in digital pathology with the advent of whole-slide imaging and machine learning algorithms. So far its application has been limited to quantifying immunostaining but is also being investigated for the standard H&E stain. CAD is an interdisciplinary technology combining elements of artificial intelligence and computer vision with radiological and pathology image processing. A typical application is the detection of a tumor. For instance, some hospitals use CAD to support preventive medical check-ups in mammography (diagnosis of breast cancer), the detection of polyps in the colon, and lung cancer. Computer-aided detection (CADe) systems are usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense structures in the soft tissue. This allows the radiologist to draw conclusions about the condition of the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., the size of a tumor or the tumor's behavior in contrast medium uptake. Computer-aided simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. negative and positive). CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required. Although CAD has been used in clinical environments for over 40 years, CAD usually does not substitute the doctor or other professional, but rather plays a supporting role. The professional (generally a radiologist) is generally responsible for the final interpretation of a medical image. However, the goal of some CAD systems is to detect earliest signs of abnormality in patients that human professionals cannot, as in , architectural distortion in mammograms, ground-glass nodules in thoracic CT, and non-polypoid (“flat”) lesions in CT colonography.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Experiment105798043 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/HigherCognitiveProcess105770664 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Inquiry105797597 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Occupation100582388 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ProblemSolving105796750 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Process105701363 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thinking105770926 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Trial105799212 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatHealthcareOccupations | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTests | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

A film is prepared using hydrophilic polymers that rapidly dissolves on the tongue or buccal cavity, delivering the drug to the systemic circulation via dissolution when contact with liquid is made. Thin-film drug delivery has emerged as an advanced alternative to the traditional tablets, capsules and liquids often associated with prescription and OTC medications. Similar in size, shape and thickness to a postage stamp, thin-film strips are typically designed for oral administration, with the user placing the strip on or under the tongue (sublingual) or along the inside of the cheek (buccal). These drug delivery options allow the medication to bypass the first pass metabolism thereby making the medication more bioavailable. As the strip dissolves, the drug can enter the blood stream enterically, buccally or sublingually. Evaluating the systemic transmucosal drug delivery, the buccal mucosa is the preferred region as compared to the sublingual mucosa. Different buccal delivery products have been marketed or are proposed for certain diseases like trigeminal neuralgia, Meniere's disease, diabetes, and addiction. There are many commercial non-drug product to use thin films like Mr. Mint and Listerine PocketPaks breath freshening strips. Since then, thin-film products for other breath fresheners, as well as a number of cold, flu, anti-snoring and gastrointestinal medications, have entered the marketplace.

For the exterior of the cell, typical values of membrane potential, normally given in units of millivolts and denoted as mV, range from –40 mV to –80 mV. All animal cells are surrounded by a membrane composed of a lipid bilayer with proteins embedded in it. The membrane serves as both an insulator and a diffusion barrier to the movement of ions. Transmembrane proteins, also known as ion transporter or ion pump proteins, actively push ions across the membrane and establish concentration gradients across the membrane, and ion channels allow ions to move across the membrane down those concentration gradients. Ion pumps and ion channels are electrically equivalent to a set of batteries and resistors inserted in the membrane, and therefore create a voltage between the two sides of the membrane. Almost all plasma membranes have an electrical potential across them, with the inside usually negative with respect to the outside. The membrane potential has two basic functions. First, it allows a cell to function as a battery, providing power to operate a variety of ""molecular devices"" embedded in the membrane. Second, in electrically excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells, it is used for transmitting signals between different parts of a cell. Signals are generated by opening or closing of ion channels at one point in the membrane, producing a local change in the membrane potential. This change in the electric field can be quickly affected by either adjacent or more distant ion channels in the membrane. Those ion channels can then open or close as a result of the potential change, reproducing the signal. In non-excitable cells, and in excitable cells in their baseline states, the membrane potential is held at a relatively stable value, called the resting potential. For neurons, typical values of the resting potential range from –70 to –80 millivolts; that is, the interior of a cell has a negative baseline voltage of a bit less than one-tenth of a volt. The opening and closing of ion channels can induce a departure from the resting potential. This is called a depolarization if the interior voltage becomes less negative (say from –70 mV to –60 mV), or a hyperpolarization if the interior voltage becomes more negative (say from –70 mV to –80 mV). In excitable cells, a sufficiently large depolarization can evoke an action potential, in which the membrane potential changes rapidly and significantly for a short time (on the order of 1 to 100 milliseconds), often reversing its polarity. Action potentials are generated by the activation of certain voltage-gated ion channels. In neurons, the factors that influence the membrane potential are diverse. They include numerous types of ion channels, some of which are chemically gated and some of which are voltage-gated. Because voltage-gated ion channels are controlled by the membrane potential, while the membrane potential itself is influenced by these same ion channels, feedback loops that allow for complex temporal dynamics arise, including oscillations and regenerative events such as action potentials.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/AmorphousShape113867492 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Attribute100024264 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cell102991711 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Compartment103080309 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Location100027167 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Shape100027807 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Space113910384 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCells | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatContractileCells | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoGeoEntity | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Disease

EEG measures voltage fluctuations resulting from ionic current within the neurons of the brain.

The latter analyses the type of neural oscillations (popularly called ""brain waves"") that can be observed in EEG signals in the frequency domain.

EEG used to be a first-line method of diagnosis for tumors, stroke and other focal brain disorders, but this use has decreased with the advent of high-resolution anatomical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Despite limited spatial resolution, EEG continues to be a valuable tool for research and diagnosis. It is one of the few mobile techniques available and offers millisecond-range temporal resolution which is not possible with CT, PET or MRI. Derivatives of the EEG technique include evoked potentials (EP), which involves averaging the EEG activity time-locked to the presentation of a stimulus of some sort (visual, somatosensory, or auditory). Event-related potentials (ERPs) refer to averaged EEG responses that are time-locked to more complex processing of stimuli; this technique is used in cognitive science, cognitive psychology, and psychophysiological research.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Application100949134 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Experiment105798043 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/HigherCognitiveProcess105770664 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Inquiry105797597 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Occupation100582388 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ProblemSolving105796750 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Process105701363 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Profession100609953 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Technology100949619 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thinking105770926 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Trial105799212 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Use100947128 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatEmergingTechnologies | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTests | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PersonFunction | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Software | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

During this state, a motor unit has been maximally stimulated by its motor neuron and remains that way for some time. This occurs when a muscle's motor unit is stimulated by multiple impulses at a sufficiently high frequency. Each stimulus causes a twitch.

If stimuli are delivered at high frequency, the twitches will overlap, resulting in tetanic contraction. A tetanic contraction can be either unfused (",literal,en,"A tetanic contraction (also called tetanized state, tetanus, or physiologic tetanus, the latter to differentiate from the disease called tetanus) is a sustained muscle contraction evoked when the motor nerve that innervates a skeletal muscle emits action potentials at a very high rate. During this state, a motor unit has been maximally stimulated by its motor neuron and remains that way for some time. This occurs when a muscle's motor unit is stimulated by multiple impulses at a sufficiently high frequency. Each stimulus causes a twitch. If stimuli are delivered slowly enough, the tension in the muscle will relax between successive twitches. If stimuli are delivered at high frequency, the twitches will overlap, resulting in tetanic contraction. A tetanic contraction can be either unfused (incomplete) or fused (complete). An unfused tetanus is when the muscle fibers do not completely relax before the next stimulus because they are being stimulated at a fast rate; however there is a partial relaxation of the muscle fibers between the twitches. Fused tetanus is when there is no relaxation of the muscle fibers between stimuli and it occurs during a high rate of stimulation. A fused tetanic contraction is the strongest single-unit twitch in contraction. When tetanized, the contracting tension in the muscle remains constant in a steady state. This is the maximal possible contraction. During tetanic contractions, muscles can shorten, lengthen or remain constant length. Tetanic contraction is usually normal (such as when holding up a heavy box). Muscles often exhibit some level of tetanic activity, leading to muscle tone, in order to maintain posture; for example, in a crouching position, some muscles require sustained contraction to hold the position. Tetanic contraction can exist in a variety of states, including isotonic and isometric forms—for example, lifting a heavy box off the floor is isotonic, but holding it at the elevated position is isometric. Isotonic contractions place muscles in a constant tension but the muscle length changes, while isometric contractions hold a constant muscle length. Voluntary sustained contraction is a normal (physiologic) process (as in the crouching or box-holding examples), but involuntary sustained contraction exists on a spectrum from physiologic to disordered (pathologic). Muscle tone is a healthy form of involuntary sustained partial contraction. In comparison with tetanic contraction in an isometric state (such as holding up a heavy box for several minutes), it differs only in the percentage of motor units participating at any moment and the frequency of neural signals; but the low percentage and low frequency in healthy tone are the key factors defining it as healthy (and not tetanic). Involuntary sustained contraction of a hypertonic type, however, is a pathologic process. On the mild part of the spectrum, cramps, spasms, and even tetany are often temporary and nonsevere. On the moderate to severe parts of the spectrum are dystonia, trismus, pathologic tetanus, and other movement disorders featuring involuntary sustained strong contractions of skeletal muscle.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ability105616246 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Attribute100024264 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Clue106643763 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Communication100033020 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Condition113920835 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Disorder114052403 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Evidence106643408 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Indication106797169 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MetabolicDisorder114084502 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalCondition114034177 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Sign106646243 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Skill105637558 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/State100024720 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalSigns | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMetabolicDisorders | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMotorSkills | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Muscle

Most implanted pacemakers are dual chambered and have two leads, causing the implantation time to take longer because of this more complicated pacemaker system.

Approximately 2.25 million pacemakers were implanted in the United States between 1990 and 2002, and of those pacemakers, about 8,834 were removed from patients because of device malfunction most commonly connected to generator abnormalities. In the 1970s, results of an Oregon study indicated that 10% of implanted pacemakers failed within the first month. Another study found that more than half of pacemaker complications occurred during the first 3 months after implantation. Causes of pacemaker failure include lead related failure, unit malfunction, problems at the insertion site, failures related to exposure to high voltage electricity or high intensity microwaves, and a miscellaneous category (one patient had ventricular tachycardia when using his electric razor and another patient had persistent pacing of the diaphragm muscle).

Most modern X-ray generators apply a constant potential across the X-ray tube; in such systems, the kVp and the steady-state kV are identical. kVp controls the property called ""radiographic contrast"" of an X-ray image (the ratio of transmitted radiation through regions of different thickness or density). Each body part contains a certain type of cellular composition which requires an X-ray beam with a certain kVp to penetrate it. The body part is said to have ""subject contrast"" (that is, different cellular make up: some dense, some not so dense tissues all within a specific body part). For example: bone to muscle to air ratios in the abdomen differ from that of the chest area. So the subject contrast is said to be higher in the chest than in the abdomen. In order to image the body so that the maximum information will result, higher subject contrast areas require a higher kVp so as to result in a low radiographic contrast image, and vice versa. Although the product of tube current and exposure time, measured in milliampere-seconds (mA·s), is the primary controlling factor of radiographic density, kVp also affects the radiographic density indirectly. As the energy (which is proportional to the peak voltage) of the stream of electrons in the X-ray tube increases, the X-ray photons created from those electrons are more likely to penetrate the cells of the body and reach the image receptor (film or plate), resulting in increased film density (compared to lower energy beams that may be absorbed in the body on their way to the image receptor). However, scattered X-rays also contribute to increased film density: the higher the kVp of the beam, the more scatter will be produced. Scatter adds unwanted density (that is, density that does not bring pertinent information to the image receptor). This is why kVp is not primarily used to control film density – as the density resulting from increasing kVp exceeds what is needed to penetrate a body part, it only adds useless photons to the image. Increasing mAs causes more photons (radiation) of the particular kVp energy, to be produced. This is helpful when larger body parts are imaged, because they require more photons. The more photons that pass through a particular tissue type (whose kVp is interacting at the cellular level), the more photons reach the image receptor. The more photons that pass through a part, and reach the image receptor with pertinent information – the more useful the film density on the resulting image. Conversely, lower mAs creates fewer photons, which will decrease film density, but is helpful when you image smaller parts. The measurements of kvp is done by kv meter. The quality of X-ray tube depend upon the kv apply across the filament at the target. A slight change in kv affect the image significantly. Therefore, it is necessary to measure kv applied to tube accurately.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiography | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Locomotive

Till, neurosurgeon at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital for children, determined that debris accumulated in the hydrocephalic ventricles could clog the slits in the Holter valves, especially with patients such as Theo who had bad bleeding in the brain and brain damage. Dahl knew Wade to be an expert in precision hydraulic engineering, from their shared hobby of flying model aircraft. (In addition to building his own model aircraft engines, Wade ran a factory at High Wycombe for producing precision hydraulic pumps.) With Dahl coordinating the efforts of the neurosurgeon and the hydraulic engineer, the team developed a new mechanism using two metal discs, each in a restrictive housing at the end of a short silicone rubber tube. Fluid moving under pressure from below pushed the discs against the tube to prevent retrograde flow; pressure from above moved each disc to the ""open"" position. As Till reported in The Lancet, the invention was characterized by “low resistance, ease of sterilisation, no reflux, robust construction, and negligible risk of blockage”. By the time the device was perfected, Theo had healed to the point at which it was no longer necessary to implant the shunt in his skull. However, several thousand other children around the world benefited from the WDT valve before medicine technology progressed beyond it.

An example of such nonclassical sources is spontaneous parametric down-conversion that generates entangled photon pairs (twin-photon). The entangled photons are emitted in pairs and have stronger-than-classical temporal and spatial correlations. The entangled photons are anti-correlated in frequencies and directions.

A correspondence between BOLD and SEEP signal changes, and sites of activity, has been observed in the brain and appears to arise from the common dependence on changes in local blood flow to cause a change in blood oxygenation or to produce extracellular fluid. The advantage of SEEP contrast is that it can be detected with MR imaging methods which are relatively insensitive to magnetic susceptibility differences between air, tissues, blood, and bone. Such susceptibility differences can give rise to spatial image distortions and areas of low signal, and magnetic susceptibility changes in blood give rise to the BOLD contrast for fMRI. The primary application of SEEP to date has been fMRI of the spinal cord (spinal fMRI) because the bone/tissue interfaces around the spinal cord cause poor image quality with conventional fMRI methods. The disadvantages of SEEP compared to BOLD contrast are that it reveals more localized areas of activity, and in the brain the signal intensity changes are typically lower, and it can therefore be more difficult to detect.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroimaging,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Organisation | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

It may also be referred to by the brand names Terylene in the UK, Lavsan in Russia and the former Soviet Union, and Dacron in the US. Bio-PET is the bio-based counterpart of PET. The majority of the world's PET production is for synthetic fibres (in excess of 60%), with bottle production accounting for about 30% of global demand. In the context of textile applications, PET is referred to by its common name, polyester, whereas the acronym PET is generally used in relation to packaging. Polyester makes up about 18% of world polymer production and is the fourth-most-produced polymer after polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). PET consists of polymerized units of the monomer ethylene terephthalate, with repeating (C10H8O4) units. PET is commonly recycled, and has the number ""1"" as its resin identification code (RIC). Depending on its processing and thermal history, polyethylene terephthalate may exist both as an amorphous (transparent) and as a semi-crystalline polymer. The semicrystalline material might appear transparent (particle size less than 500 nm) or opaque and white (particle size up to a few micrometers) depending on its crystal structure and particle size. The monomer bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate can be synthesized by the esterification reaction between terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol with water as a byproduct (this is also known as a condensation reaction), or by transesterification reaction between ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) with methanol as a byproduct.

The commonly known brand name of PTFE-based compositions is Teflon™ by Chemours, a spin-off from DuPont, which originally discovered the compound in 1938. Polytetrafluoroethylene is a fluorocarbon solid (at room temperature), as it is a high molecular weight polymer consisting wholly of carbon and fluorine. PTFE is hydrophobic: neither water nor water-containing substances wet PTFE, as fluorocarbons demonstrate mitigated London dispersion forces due to the high electronegativity of fluorine. PTFE has one of the lowest coefficients of friction of any solid. Polytetrafluoroethylene is used as a non-stick coating for pans and other cookware. It is non-reactive, partly because of the strength of carbon–fluorine bonds, and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. Where used as a lubricant, PTFE reduces friction, wear, and energy consumption of machinery. It is commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions. It is also frequently employed as coating on catheters; this interferes with the ability of bacteria and other infectious agents to adhere to catheters and cause hospital-acquired infections.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ChemicalCompound | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ChemicalSubstance | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Drug | http://umbel.org/umbel/rc/ChemicalSubstanceType | http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#ChemicalObject | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11173

Sometimes, patients must be rapidly taken out of the anesthetized state and this may not be possible or as easy if anesthesiology carts are not utilized. The design of Anesthesia supply carts allows for easy transportation between rooms and could be used in multiple operating rooms. Medical personnel save time and energy by not having to seek out and gather anesthesia tools. Many optimized features are available for anesthesiology carts. To keep anesthesia tools safe and in the hands of authorized users, locking drawers are a useful option. These same anesthesiology supplies cart drawers glide smoothly on rolling sliders to prevent displacement or wobbling. Built-in stabilizing bases increase anesthesia storage cart stability and prevent tipping during transport. Easy-grip push handles and smooth-rolling and locking casters provide for maximum anesthesiologist cart maneuverability.

The aim of intermittent hypoxic training or conducted with such a device is to obtain benefits in physical performance and wellbeing through improved oxygen metabolism. There are several commercial systems available. Most of these systems have not been cleared for medical applications by the FDA and are used by athletes for altitude training. Advanced hypoxicators have a built-in pulse oximeter used to monitor and in some cases control the temporary reduction of arterial oxygen saturation that results in physiological responses evident at both systemic and cellular levels even after only a few minutes of hypoxia. Hypoxic Training Index (HTi) can be used to measure the delivered therapeutic dosage over the training session. The underlying mechanisms of adaptation to mild, non-damaging, short-term (minutes) hypoxic stress (also called - intermittent hypoxic training) are complex and diverse, but are part of normal physiology and are opposite to patho-physiological effects of severe sleep apnea hypoxia. There are a number of types of hypoxicators that can be distinguished by the method of producing hypoxic air and its delivery to the user's respiratory system. Commonly used are air separation systems employing semi-permeable membrane technology or pressure swing adsorption or (PSAS). There are also non-powered hand-held devices – . The term hypoxicator was suggested by Russian scientists in 1985 to describe a new class of devices for Intermittent hypoxic training (IHT) – an emerging drug-free treatment for a wide range of degenerative disorders and forsimulated altitude training used to achieve greater endurance performance as well as offering pre-acclimatisation for mountaineers – minimising the risk of succumbing to acute mountain sickness on a subsequent ascent. The hypoxia challenge of IHT is normally delivered in an intermittent manner: 3-7 min of hypoxic air breathing alternated with 1-5 min of normoxic or hyperoxic air. The hypoxicator allows automated and pre-programmed delivery of the required hypoxic and hyperoxic or normoxic air and safety monitoring. The therapeutic range of arterial oxygen desaturation for IHT is SpO2 =75% - 88% and must be selected based upon the recommendation of a medical specialist. Studies have also shown that hypoxic air treatment may increase the recovery speed and endurance of spinal cord injuries. There are no reported adverse effects associated with this kind of treatment. However, symptoms of over-training may appear as a result of abusing basic training protocols supplied by manufacturers. Products that do not offer effective and instant monitoring and control over the treatment sessions must be avoided.

A head mirror is mostly used for examination of the ear, nose & throat. It comprises a circular concave mirror, with a small hole in the middle, and is attached to a head band. The mirror is worn over the physician's eye of choice, with the concave mirror surface facing outwards and the hole directly over the physician's eye, providing illumination like a ring light. In use, the patient sits and faces the physician. A bright lamp is positioned adjacent to the patient's head, pointing toward the physician's face and hence towards the head mirror. The light from the lamp reflects off the mirror, along the line of sight of the user, with the light being somewhat concentrated by the curvature of the mirror. When used properly, the head mirror thus provides excellent shadow-free illumination. Because they were once in common use, notably by general practitioners and otorhinolaryngologists, head mirrors are often a stereotypical part of a physician's uniform by costumers and prop men e.g. in comic routines. The main drawback to head mirrors was that they required some skill to use well. They are rarely seen outside of the ENT setting, having been largely replaced by pen lights among general practitioners. They are still used by some otolaryngologists, particularly for examinations and procedures involving the oral cavity, although many are switching to fiber optic head lights.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_testing_equipment,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Mirror103773035 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Reflector104069276 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMirrors | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Device

Etonogestrel is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It works by stopping ovulation, thickening the mucus around the opening of the cervix, and altering the lining of the uterus. It has very weak androgenic and glucocorticoid activity and no other important hormonal activity. Etonogestrel was patented in 1972 and introduced for medical use in 1998. It became available in the United States in 2006. Etonogestrel implants are approved in more than 90 countries and used by about three million women globally as of 2010.

Automated whole-breast ultrasound (AWBU) is an ultrasound investigation of the breast that is largely independent of the operator skill and that allows the reconstruction of volumetric images of the breast. Using high-frequency ultrasound, a diagnostic evaluation of the lactiferous ducts by means of ultrasound (duct sonography) can be performed. In this manner, dilated ducts and intraductal masses can be made visible. Another technique for visualizing the system of lactiferous ducts is galactography, which allows a wider area of the lactiferous duct system to be visualized. A type of ultrasound examination to measure tissue stiffness, which is used to detect tumours, is elastography. Breast ultrasound is also used to perform fine-needle aspiration biopsy and ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of breast abscesses.Some women prefer breast ultrasound over mammography because they dislike the pain felt during squeezing or fixing of breast done during mammography for X-ray views. Breast ultrasound is painless procedure.Breast ultrasound is usually done with frequency 7 Megahertz to 14 Megahertz.Breast ultrasound includes ultrasound of axillary tail of breast and sometime it includes ultrasound of axillae also to detect abnormal nodes in axilla because lymphatic drainage of parts of breast occur through axillary lymph nodes.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Breast_imaging | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_ultrasonography,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

In the following few hours or weeks will be a few symptoms, which later become additional symptoms, after which either recovery or death follow. ARS involves a total dose of greater than 0.7 Gy (70 rad), that generally occurs from a source outside the body, delivered within a few minutes. Sources of such radiation can occur accidentally or intentionally. They may involve nuclear reactors, cyclotrons, and certain devices used in cancer therapy. It is generally divided into three types: bone marrow, gastrointestinal, and neurovascular syndrome, with bone marrow syndrome occurring at 0.7 to 10 Gy, and neurovascular syndrome occurring at doses that exceed 50 Gy. The cells that are most affected are generally those that are rapidly dividing. At high doses, this causes DNA damage that may be irreparable. Diagnosis is based on a history of exposure and symptoms. Repeated complete blood counts (CBCs) can indicate the severity of exposure. Treatment of ARS is generally supportive care. This may include blood transfusions, antibiotics, colony-stimulating factors, or stem cell transplant. Radioactive material remaining on the skin or in the stomach should be removed. If radioiodine was inhaled or ingested, potassium iodide is recommended. Complications like leukemia and other cancers among those who survive are managed as usual. Short term outcomes depend on the dose exposure. ARS is generally rare. A single event, however, can affect a relatively large number of people. Notable cases occurred following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. ARS differs from chronic radiation syndrome, which occurs following prolonged exposures to relatively low doses of radiation.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Attribute100024264 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Complex105870365 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Concept105835747 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Condition113920835 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Content105809192 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Crisis107417644 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Disease114070360 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Emergency107417405 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Happening107283608 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Idea105833840 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/IllHealth114052046 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Illness114061805 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Injury114285662 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Juncture107416714 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PathologicalState114051917 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalCondition114034177 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/State100024720 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Syndrome105870790 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole105869584 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatInjuries | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalEmergencies | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSyndromes | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Book | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Disease | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12136

The resulting signal is called the electrooculogram. Primary applications are in ophthalmological diagnosis and in recording eye movements. Unlike the electroretinogram, the EOG does not measure response to individual visual stimuli. To measure eye movement, pairs of electrodes are typically placed either above and below the eye or to the left and right of the eye. If the eye moves from center position toward one of the two electrodes, this electrode ""sees"" the positive side of the retina and the opposite electrode ""sees"" the negative side of the retina. Consequently, a potential difference occurs between the electrodes.

However, even an experienced surgeon despite using advanced techniques may not be able to fully prevent the formation of adhesions following surgery, without the aid of an adhesion barrier. Consequently, many surgeons apply adhesion barriers while performing abdominal and pelvic surgery. However, one study found the frequency of adhesion barrier use to be very low.

Then, to define the electrical activity, two interpenetrating domains are considered, which are the intracellular and extracellular domains, representing respectively the space inside the cells and the region between them. The bidomain model was first proposed by Schmitt in 1969 before being formulated mathematically in the late 1970s. Since it is a continuum model, rather than describing each cell individually, it represents the avarage properties and behaviour of group of cells organized in complex structure. Thus, the model results to be a complex one and can be seen as a generalization of the cable theory to higher dimensions and, going to define the so called bidomain equations. Many of the interesting properties of the bidomain model arise from the condition of unequal anisotropy ratios. The electrical conductivity in anisotropic tissues is not unique in all directions, but it is different in parallel and perpendicular direction with respect to the fiber one.Moreover, in tissues with unequal anisotropy ratios, the ratio of conductivities parallel and perpendicular to the fibers are different in the intracellular and extracellular spaces. For instance, in cardiac tissue, the anisotropy ratio in the intracellular space is about 10:1, while in the extracellular space it is about 5:2.Mathematically, unequal anisotropy ratios means that the effect of anisotropy cannot be removed by a change in the distance scale in one direction.Instead, the anisotropy has a more profound influence on the electrical behavior. Three examples of the impact of unequal anisotropy ratios are 
* the distribution of transmembrane potential during unipolar stimulation of a sheet of cardiac tissue, 
* the magnetic field produced by an action potential wave front propagating through cardiac tissue, 
* the effect of fiber curvature on the transmembrane potential distribution during an electric shock.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cardiac_electrophysiology | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person

It is often used when viewing intracranial lesions with abnormal vascularity or abnormalities in the blood–brain barrier. It is usually injected intravenously. Gd-DTPA is classed as an acyclic, ionic gadolinium contrast medium. Its paramagnetic property reduces the T1 relaxation time (and to some extent the T2 and T2* relaxation times) in NMR, which is the source of its clinical utility. Marketed as Magnevist by Bayer AG, it was the first intravenous contrast agent to become available for clinical use, and is in widespread use around the world. Magnevist is a clear, colorless to slightly yellow solution containing 0.5 mmol gadopentetate dimeglumine/mL(equivalent to 469.01 mg/mL of gadopentetate dimeglumine). Similar contrast agents are Magnetol manufactured by Isorad, Dotarem (gadoterate) manufactured by Guerbet, MultiHance (gadobenate dimeglumine) and ProHance (gadoteridol) manufactured by Bracco, Omniscan (gadodiamide) manufactured by GE Healthcare, and OptiMARK (gadoversetamide) manufactured by Mallinckrodt. Gadolinium based agents may cause a toxic reaction known as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with severe kidney problems. Compared to other gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents, Gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA2-) chelates allow delayed Gadolinium-enhanced Magnetic Resonance of Cartilage (dGEMRIC).

Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part of adjuvant therapy, to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotherapy, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers. The subspecialty of oncology concerned with radiotherapy is called radiation oncologist. Radiation therapy is commonly applied to the cancerous tumor because of its ability to control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging the DNA of cancerous tissue leading to cellular death. To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger absorbed dose there than in the surrounding healthy tissue. Besides the tumour itself, the radiation fields may also include the draining lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with the tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of subclinical malignant spread. It is necessary to include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor to allow for uncertainties in daily set-up and internal tumor motion. These uncertainties can be caused by internal movement (for example, respiration and bladder filling) and movement of external skin marks relative to the tumor position. Radiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation, and is distinct from radiology, the use of radiation in medical imaging and diagnosis. Radiation may be prescribed by a radiation oncologist with intent to cure (""curative"") or for adjuvant therapy. It may also be used as palliative treatment (where cure is not possible and the aim is for local disease control or symptomatic relief) or as therapeutic treatment (where the therapy has survival benefit and can be curative). It is also common to combine radiation therapy with surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy or some mixture of the four. Most common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way. The precise treatment intent (curative, adjuvant, neoadjuvant therapeutic, or palliative) will depend on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant. Brachytherapy, in which a radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, acoustic neuromas, severe thyroid eye disease, pterygium, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and prevention of keloid scar growth, vascular restenosis, and heterotopic ossification. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiation_therapy,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Drug | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

These temporary abdominal closure techniques are most commonly used in cases of abdominal compartment syndrome in which decompressive laparotomy is necessary to reduce intra-abdominal pressure to restore blood flow. The Bogota bag is used to postpone definite closure until the underlying cause of the elevated intra-abdominal pressure can be resolved. Other techniques include the use of absorbable mesh, the Wittmann patch, negative pressure wound therapy and dynamic closure systems. These techniques are characterized by a tension-free closure. In addition, the Bogota bag acts as a hermetic barrier that prevents disembowelment and loss of fluids.

The second method involves rotating the X-ray source and camera around the object, as is done in ordinary CT scanning and SPECT imaging. This adds complexity, size and cost to the system, but removes the need to rotate the object.

It basically consists of a revolving drum wrapped with a sheet of paper on which a stylus moves back and forth recording perceived changes of phenomena such as motion or pressure. The kymograph was initially a mechanical and hydraulic device, invented by German physiologist Carl Ludwig in the 1840s, and found its first use as a means to monitor blood pressure. The blood pressure was conveyed by hydraulics and levers to move a stylus that scratched a white trace into soot-covered paper on the revolving drum. Time is represented by the drum's rotation rate, and was recorded by a further stylus driven by a clock or tuning fork. The kymograph almost immediately became the central instrument in physiology and physiology education. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, researchers and technicians devised many improvements to the device, plus numerous new sensory components to measure a wide range of physiological phenomena such as breathing, muscle movement, speech. New detection and registration systems included electrical and electronic methods, and plotted in ink.

This new 3D imaging method and the new scientific term ""Depth-Kymography"" are introduced by Dr.Nibu A George, Prof.Frits de Mul and Prof.Harm Schutte. from the University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands in 2007. The term ""Depth-Kymography"" is included in the current medical terminology. Human vocal folds vibrate in a very complex manner. During phonation vocal folds move in the horizontal and vertical directions. The imaging of the vocal fold vibrations is done by inserting an endoscope through the mouth and the vocal folds are viewed from the top. Hence, with a normal endoscope only the horizontal movements of the vocal folds are visible. Endoscopes used for the visualization of larynx is commonly known as Laryngoscope. With a specially designed 3D laryngoscope, movement of the vocal folds in the horizontal and the vertical directions can be simultaneously measured and displayed with horizontal and vertical displacements forms the two orthogonal planes while time is the third dimension. With this method, researchers were also able to measure the mucosal wave propagation. Depth-kymography has great potential in the investigation of voice disorders and in phonosurgical applications. Depth-Kymography is the next generation of the popular videokymography.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_imaging,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ArchitecturalStructure

Another notable observation is the strong propensity of RTI-55 to cause locomotor activity enhancements, although in an earlier study, RTI-51 was actually even stronger than RTI-55 in shifting baseline LMA. This observation serves to highlight the disparities that can arise between studies. RTI-55 is one of the most potent phenyltropane stimulants commercially available, which limits its use in humans, as it might have significant abuse potential if used outside a strictly controlled medical setting. However, it is definitely worthy of mentioning that increasing the size of the halogen atom attached to troparil serves to reduce the number of lever responses in a session when these analogs were compared in a study. Although RTI-55 wasn't specifically examined in this study the number of lever responses in a given session was of the order cocaine > WIN35428 > RTI-31 > RTI-51. In contrast to RTI-31 which is predominantly dopaminergic, increasing the size of the covalently bonded halogen from a chlorine to an iodine markedly increases the affinity for the SERT, while retaining mostly all of its DAT blocking activity. The radiopharmaceutical forms of RTI-55, in which the iodine atom is radioiodine so that the drug can be used in single-photon emission computed tomography, are called iometopane I 123 (USAN) or iometopane 123I (INN) and iometopane I 125 (USAN) or iometopane 125I (INN).

Such activity is required by higher level regulation and other quality management system standards such as ISO 13485. Specifically, ISO 14971 is a nine-part standard which first establishes a framework for risk analysis, evaluation, control, and review, and also specifies a procedure for review and monitoring during production and post-production.

A receptor potential can also cause the release of neurotransmitters from one cell that will act on another cell, generating an action potential in the second cell. The magnitude of the receptor potential determines the frequency with which action potentials are generated, and is controlled by adaption, stimulus strength, and temporal summation of successive receptor potentials. Receptor potential relies on receptor sensitivity which can adapt slowly, resulting in a slowly decaying receptor potential or rapidly, resulting in a quickly generated but shorter lasting receptor potential. An example of a receptor potential is in a taste bud, where taste is converted into an electrical signal sent to the brain. When stimulated, the taste bud triggers the release of neurotransmitter through exocytosis of synaptic vesicles from the presynaptic membrane.

This is in contrast to matched and population controls, where the RAI was significantly below 1.0. This simple numeric parameter has found a role in the diagnostic work-up for possible shunt defects on standard tranthorcaic echocardiograms. The RAI rapidly normalizes within 24 hours of percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects. Secondary validation studies have confirmed the data in discrete patient populations. This parameter has been shown to predict long-term survival after acute pulmonary embolism.

Given their important functionalities and the relative small invasiveness, the electrocardiography techniques are used quite often as clinical diagnostic tests. Thus, it is natural to proceed to computationally reproduce an ECG, which means to mathematically model the cardiac behaviour inside the body. The three main parts of a forward model for the ECG are: 
* a model for the cardiac electrical activity; 
* a model for the diffusion of the electrical potential inside the torso, which represents the extracardiac region; 
* some specific heart-torso coupling conditions. Thus, to obtain an ECG, a mathematical electrical cardiac model must be considered, coupled with a diffusive model in a passive conductor that describes the electrical propagation inside the torso. The coupled model is usually a three-dimensional model expressed in terms of partial differential equations. Such model is typically solved by means of finite element method for the solution's space evolution and involving finite differences for the solution's time evolution. However, the computational costs of such techniques, especially with three dimensional simulations, are quite high. Thus, simplified models are often considered, solving for example the heart electrical activity independently from the problem on the torso. To provide realistic results, three dimensional anatomically-realistic models of the heart and the torso must be used.

The AL is intended to take over some of the functionality of biological lungs. It is different from a heart-lung machine in that it is external and designed to take over the functions of the lungs for long periods of time rather than on a temporary basis. The heart-lung machine inspired the design of AL devices, however, modern ALs are optimised to minimize patient trauma. Following the development of the heart-lung machine, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), using a membrane oxygenator, was developed. This was intended to be used as a bridge to lung transplant (BTT), for patients too sick to wait until a donor lung was available. Mechanical Ventilation (MV) has also been used, however, it is damaging to the patient's lungs if used for extended periods of time. Both these therapies are expensive and are associated with poor quality of life, in part due to complex blood circuits required for these techniques to work. Recent developments include simplifying the ECMO system, and devices that use 380 micron wide hollow fibers to simulate the function of alveoli have been developed. Several research groups, notably, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Michigan, University of Maryland and Boston based groups are developing AL devices to bridge patients to lung transplant.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/BodyPart105220461 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Organ105297523 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part109385911 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thing100002452 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatArtificialOrgans | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Device

Bone cement chemically is nothing more than Plexiglas (i.e. polymethyl methacrylate or PMMA). PMMA was used clinically for the first time in the 1940s in plastic surgery to close gaps in the skull. Comprehensive clinical tests of the compatibility of bone cements with the body were conducted before their use in surgery. The excellent tissue compatibility of PMMA allowed bone cements to be used for anchorage of head prostheses in the 1950s. Today several million procedures of this type are conducted every year all over the world and more than half of them routinely use bone cements – and the proportion is increasing. Bone cement is considered a reliable anchorage material with its ease of use in clinical practice and particularly because of its proven long survival rate with cemented-in prostheses.

The variety of medical imaging technologies used in planning includes x-ray computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) among others. The precision of IGRT is significantly improved when technologies that were originally developed for image-guided surgery, such as the N-localizer and Sturm-Pastyr localizer, are used in conjunction with these medical imaging technologies.

The halo sign is also understood as a region of ground-glass attenuation surrounding a pulmonary nodule on an X-ray computed tomography (CT scan) of the chest. It can be associated with hemorrhagic nodules, tumors, or inflammatory processes, but is most commonly known as an early radiographic sign of invasive pulmonary infection by the fungus species Aspergillus. In nursing, the halo sign is the result of a test to see if drainage from a head injury contains cerebrospinal fluid. When a Dextrostix or Tes-Tape test gives a positive reading for glucose, the drainage must be further tested because glucose is also found in the blood. To perform the test, the leaking fluid is dripped onto a 4x4 gauze or towel.

The same material can be used as a casting resin or in inks and coatings, among many other uses. Although not a type of familiar silica-based glass, the substance, like many thermoplastics, is often technically classified as a type of glass (in that it is a non-crystalline vitreous substance), hence its occasional historic designation as acrylic glass. Chemically, it is the synthetic polymer of methyl methacrylate. The material was developed in 1928 in several different laboratories by many chemists, such as William Chalmers, Otto Röhm, and Walter Bauer, and was first brought to market in 1933 by German Röhm & Haas AG (as of January 2019, part of Evonik Industries) and its partner and former U.S. affiliate Rohm and Haas Company under the trademark Plexiglas. PMMA is an economical alternative to polycarbonate (PC) when tensile strength, flexural strength, transparency, polishability, and UV tolerance are more important than impact strength, chemical resistance, and heat resistance. Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful bisphenol-A subunits found in polycarbonate and is a far better choice for laser cutting. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when under load, especially under an impact force, and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA is sometimes able to achieve high scratch and impact resistance.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Chemical114806838 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Compound114818238 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ester114850483 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Insulator114821590 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/OrganicCompound114727670 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Polymer114994328 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCarboxylateEsters | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDentalMaterials | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDielectrics | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatOpticalMaterials | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatPolymers | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatTransparentMaterials | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ChemicalCompound | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ChemicalSubstance | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Drug | http://umbel.org/umbel/rc/ChemicalSubstanceType | http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#ChemicalObject | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11173

Two- and three-dimensional image reconstruction may be rendered as a function of a common software and control system. PET-CT has revolutionized medical diagnosis in many fields, by adding precision of anatomic localization to functional imaging, which was previously lacking from pure PET imaging. For example, many diagnostic imaging procedures in oncology, surgical planning, radiation therapy and cancer staging have been changing rapidly under the influence of PET-CT availability, and centers have been gradually abandoning conventional PET devices and substituting them by PET-CTs. Although the combined/hybrid device is considerably more expensive, it has the advantage of providing both functions as stand-alone examinations, being, in fact, two devices in one. The only other obstacle to the wider use of PET-CT is the difficulty and cost of producing and transporting the radiopharmaceuticals used for PET imaging, which are usually extremely short-lived (for instance, the half life of radioactive Fluorine-18 (18F) used to trace glucose metabolism (using fluorodeoxyglucose, FDG) is only two hours.

As of 1999, only one such product had been approved for sale by the FDA, based on a technique for electrically pulling glucose through intact skin, and it was withdrawn after a short time owing to poor performance and occasional damage to the skin of users. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in companies who have sought the solution to this long-standing problem. Approaches that have been tried include near infrared spectroscopy (measuring glucose through the skin using light of slightly longer wavelengths than the visible region), transdermal measurement (attempting to pull glucose through the skin using either chemicals, electricity or ultrasound), measuring the amount that polarized light is rotated by glucose in the front chamber of the eye (containing the aqueous humor), and many others. Measuring glucose through the skin presents a number of significant challenges, leading some to believe that the eye could provide the long term solution for a non-invasive glucose monitor. A 2012 study reviewed ten technologies: bioimpedance spectroscopy, microwave/RF sensing, fluorescence technology, mid-infrared spectroscopy, near infrared spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography, optical polarimetry, raman spectroscopy, reverse iontophoresis, and ultrasound technology, concluding with the observation that none of these had produced a commercially available, clinically reliable device and that therefore, much work remained to be done. As of 2014, disregarding the severe shortcomings mentioned above, at least one non-invasive glucose meter was being marketed in a number of countries. Still, as the mean absolute deviation of this device was nearly 30% in clinical trials, 'further research efforts were desired to significantly improve the accuracy [...]'. While multiple technologies have been tried, Raman Spectroscopy has gained traction as one promising technology for measuring glucose in interstitial fluid. Early attempts include C8 Medisensors and the Laser Biomedical Research Center at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) which have been working on a Raman spectroscopy sensor for more than 20 years and conducting clinical investigations in collaboration with the Clinical Research Center at University of Missouri – Columbia. In 2018 a paper in PLOS ONE showed independent validation data from a clinical investigation comprising 15 subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1 with a Mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of 25.8%. The system used, was a custom-built confocal Raman setup. In 2019 researchers at the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Samsung Electronics, in collaboration with the Laser Biomedical Research Center Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed a new approach based on Raman spectroscopy that allowed them to see the glucose signal directly. The researchers tested the system in pigs and could get accurate glucose readings for up to an hour after initial calibration. In 2020, German Institute for Diabetes-Technology have published data from 15 subjects with type 1 diabetes on a new prototype GlucoBeam based on Raman spectroscopy from RSP Systems Denmark. Showing a MARD of 23.6% on independent validation in out-patient setup with up till 8 days without recalibration. With accuracy on marketed BGM devices in the US between 5.6 and 20.8%. A NIGM solution would likely need to have an accuracy with a MARD below 20% to be widely accepted. The number of clinical trials of non-invasive glucose monitors has grown throughout the 21st century.

Thus, the French size is roughly equivalent to the circumference of a circular catheter; the true circumference being slightly larger (circumference = diameter * π where π is approximately 3.14). A round catheter of 1 French has an external diameter of 1⁄3 mm, and therefore the diameter of a round catheter in millimetres can be determined by dividing the French size by 3: 1 mm = 3 FrFr = 1/3 mm For example, if the French size is 9, the diameter is 9/3 = 3.0; mm. It is seen that the French unit is fully redundant with the metric system but introduces potential for rounding errors. This metrication problem is further complicated by the mixed use of metric and imperial units in medical professions using catheters. An increasing French size corresponds to a larger external diameter. This is contrary to Birmingham gauge, where an increasing gauge corresponds to a smaller diameter needle. The French size is a measure of the outer diameter of a catheter (not internal drainage channel, or inner diameter). So, for example, if a two-way catheter of 20 Fr is compared to a 20 Fr three-way catheter, they both have the same external diameter but the two-way catheter will have a larger drainage channel than the three-way. Three-way catheters accommodate an extra channel for irrigation within a similar external diameter.

The personnel that perform CT scans are called radiographers or radiology technologists. CT scanners use a rotating x-ray tube and a row of detectors placed in the gantry to measure X-ray attenuations by different tissues inside the body. The multiple X-ray measurements taken from different angles are then processed on a computer using reconstruction algorithms to produce tomographic (cross-sectional) images (virtual ""slices"") of a body. The use of ionizing radiations sometimes restricts its use owing to its adverse effects. However, CT can be used in patients with metallic implants or pacemakers where MRI is contraindicated. Since its development in the 1970s, CT has proven to be a versatile imaging technique. While CT is most prominently used in diagnostic medicine, it also may be used to form images of non-living objects. The 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to South African-American physicist Allan M. Cormack and British electrical engineer Godfrey N.

In an emulsion, one liquid (the dispersed phase) is dispersed in the other (the continuous phase). Examples of emulsions include vinaigrettes, homogenized milk, liquid biomolecular condensates, and some cutting fluids for metal working. Two liquids can form different types of emulsions.

Second, they can form a water-in-oil emulsion, in which water is the dispersed phase and oil is the continuous phase. Multiple emulsions are also possible, including a ""water-in-oil-in-water"" emulsion and an ""oil-in-water-in-oil"" emulsion. Emulsions, being liquids, do not exhibit a static internal structure. The droplets dispersed in the continuous phase (sometimes referred to as the ""dispersion medium"") are usually assumed to be statistically distributed to produce roughly spherical droplets. The term ""emulsion"" is also used to refer to the photo-sensitive side of photographic film. Such a photographic emulsion consists of silver halide colloidal particles dispersed in a gelatin matrix.

Among birth control methods, IUDs, along with other contraceptive implants, result in the greatest satisfaction among users. IUDs are safe and effective in adolescents as well as those who have not previously had children. Once an IUD is removed, even after long-term use, fertility returns to normal rapidly. Copper devices have a failure rate of about 0.8% while hormonal (levonorgestrel) devices fail about 0.2% of the time within the first year of use. In comparison, male sterilization and male condoms have a failure rate of about 0.15% and 15%, respectively. Copper IUDs can also be used as emergency contraception within five days of unprotected sex. Although copper IUDs may increase menstrual bleeding and result in painful cramps, hormonal IUDs may reduce menstrual bleeding or stop menstruation altogether. However, women can have daily spotting for several months and it can take up to three months for there to be a 90% decrease in bleeding. Cramping can be treated with NSAIDs. More serious potential complications include expulsion (2–5%) and rarely perforation of the uterus (less than 0.7%). IUDs do not affect breastfeeding and can be inserted immediately after delivery. They may also be used immediately after an abortion. The use of IUDs has increased within the United States from 0.8% in 1995 to 7.2% from the period of 2006 to 2014. The use of IUDs as a form of birth control dates from the 1800s. A previous model known as the Dalkon shield was associated with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). However, current models do not affect PID risk in women without sexually transmitted infections during the time of insertion.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Device

uri,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spike_sorting,literal,en,Spike sorting,literal,en,Spike sorting is a class of techniques used in the analysis of electrophysiological data. Spike sorting algorithms use the shape(s) of waveforms collected with one or more electrodes in the brain to distinguish the activity of one or more neurons from background electrical noise. Technically this is often achieved based on different sizes of the spikes (simple but inaccurate version) or more sophisticated analyses which make use of the entire waveform of the spikes. The techniques often use tools such as principal components or wavelet analysis.,literal,en,"Spike sorting is a class of techniques used in the analysis of electrophysiological data. Spike sorting algorithms use the shape(s) of waveforms collected with one or more electrodes in the brain to distinguish the activity of one or more neurons from background electrical noise. Neurons produce action potentials that are referred to as 'spikes' in laboratory jargon. Frequently this term is used for electrical signals recorded in the vicinity of individual neurons with a microelectrode (exception: 'spikes' in EEG recordings). In these recordings action potentials appear as sharp spikes (deviations from the baseline). These extracellular electrodes pick up all the components constituting the field at the point of its contact. This includes the component due to the synaptic currents and the action potentials. The synaptic currents have slower time course and the spikes have faster time course. They are thus easily separated by filtering: highpass for spikes and low pass for the synaptic mechanisms. The component of the field due to the synaptic mechanism is referred to as the local field potential (LFP). Spike sorting refers to the process of assigning spikes to different neurons. The background to this is that the exact time course of a spike event as recorded by the electrode depends on the size and shape of the neuron, the position of the recording electrode relative to the neuron, etc. These electrodes, positioned outside of the cells in the tissue, however, often 'see' the spikes generated by several neurons in their vicinity. Since the spike shapes are unique and quite reproducible for each neuron they can be used to distinguish spikes produced by different neurons, i.e. to separate the activity produced by each. Technically this is often achieved based on different sizes of the spikes (simple but inaccurate version) or more sophisticated analyses which make use of the entire waveform of the spikes. The techniques often use tools such as principal components or wavelet analysis. Multiple electrodes record different waveforms for each individual spike elicited by the neurons in the vicinity of the electrodes. The geometric configuration of the electrodes can then be used to define additional dimensions to analyze which spikes originated from which individual cell in the recorded population of cells. Thus the spike sorting using multiple electrodes is better than sorting based simply on waveform shape. The most popular setup involves the use of four micro electrodes, called 'tetrodes' (different from the vacuum tube Tetrode), though more electrodes may be used. Recording electrodes can be metal wires or fine print on a PCB with gold or platinum plated at their exposed tips to ensure good contact and prevent change in resistance while the experiment is going on.

The four members of this family form voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that seem to be specific to sperm. As sperm encounter the more alkaline environment of the female reproductive tract, CatSper channels become activated by the altered ion concentration. These channels are required for proper fertilization. The study of these channels has been slow because they do not traffic to the cell membrane in many heterologous systems. There are several factors that can activate the CatSper calcium channel, depending on species. In the human, the channel is activated by progesterone released by the oocyte. Progesterone binds to the protein ABHD2 which is present in the sperm plasma membrane, which causes ABHD2 to cleave an inhibitor of CatSper (2-arachidonoylglycerol) into arachidonic acid and glycerol. The human CatSper channel is pH-sensitive, and requires a high-pH environment. CatSper plays a key role in mediating hyperactive motility – prior to fertilization, sperm become entrapped within the fingerlike projections of the microvilli of the oviduct. In order for the sperm to fertilize the oocyte, CatSper must be present in order to initiate hyperactive motility, allowing the sperm to escape the microvilli and reach the oocyte for fertilization. Of the four members of the Catsper family, Catsper1 is found in the primary piece of sperm. Catsper1 plays an important role in evoked Ca2+ entry and regulation of hyperactivation in sperm. Catsper2 is localized in the sperm tail and is responsible for regulation of hyperactivation. Catsper3 and Catsper4 are found in both, the testes and sperm and play an important role in the motility of hyperactivated sperm. In humans, CatSper is distributed in quadrilateral nanodomains along the principal piece. Although Catsper seems to play an important role in sperm function, Catspers1-4 null mice have been found to have normal testicular histology, sperm counts and morphology, which is indicative of normal progression of spermatogenesis.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Channel106259898 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Chemical114806838 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Communication106252138 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Compound114818238 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Macromolecule114944888 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Molecule114682133 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/OrganicCompound114727670 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Protein114728724 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thing100002452 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Transmission106251781 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Unit109465459 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatIonChannels | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatProteins | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Biomolecule | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Protein | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/TelevisionStation | http://umbel.org/umbel/rc/ProteinMolecule | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q206229 | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8054

This type of emulsion was named after S.U. Pickering, who described the phenomenon in 1907, although the effect was first recognized by Walter Ramsden in 1903. If oil and water are mixed and small oil droplets are formed and dispersed throughout the water, eventually the droplets will coalesce to decrease the amount of energy in the system. However, if solid particles are added to the mixture, they will bind to the surface of the interface and prevent the droplets from coalescing, making the emulsion more stable. Properties such as hydrophobicity, shape, and size of the particle can have an effect on the stability of the emulsion. The particle’s contact angle to the surface of the droplet is a characteristic of the hydrophobicity. If the contact angle of the particle to the interface is low, the particle will be mostly wetted by the droplet and therefore will not be likely to prevent coalescence of the droplets. Particles that are partially hydrophobic (i.e. contact angle of approximately 90°) are better stabilizers because they are partially wettable by both liquids and therefore bind better to the surface of the droplets. The stabilization energy is given by where r is the particle radius, is the interfacial tension, and is the contact angle. When the contact angle is approximately 90°, the energy required to stabilize the system is at its minimum.Generally, the phase that preferentially wets the particle will be the continuous phase in the emulsion system. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the stability of the Pickering emulsions can be improved by the use of amphiphilic ""Janus particles"", namely particles that have one hydrophobic and one hydrophilic side, due to the higher adsorption energy of the particles at the liquid-liquid interface. This is evident when observing emulsion stabilization using polyelectrolytes. Homogenised milk is an example of a Pickering-stabilized emulsion. Casein (protein) units are adsorbed at the surface of milk fat globules and act as a surfactant. The casein replaces the milkfat globule membrane, which is damaged during homogenisation. It is possible to use latex particles for Pickering stabilization and then fuse these particles to form a permeable shell or capsule, called a colloidosome. Moreover, Pickering emulsion droplets are also suitable templates for micro-encapsulation and the formation of closed, non-permeable capsules. This form of encapsulation can also be applied to water-in-water emulsions (dispersions of phase-separated aqueous polymer solutions), and can also be reversible.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Form106290637 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LanguageUnit106284225 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Mixture114586258 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatChemicalMixtures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDosageForms | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Word106286395

FIM can be considered a bridge between Four Electrode Impedance Measurement (FEIM) and Electrical impedance Tomography (EIT), and provides a middle ground in terms of simplicity and accuracy. Many biological parameters and processes can be detected and monitored through their effects on bioimpedance. Bioimpedance measurement can be performed with a few simple instruments and non-invasively. Measurement of electrical impedance to obtain physiological or diagnostic information has been of interest to researchers for many years. However, the human body is geometrically and conductively uneven, with variation between individuals and phases of normal body activity, and bioimpedance results from many factors, including ion concentrations, cell geometry, extra-cellular fluids, intra-cellular fluids, and organ geometry. This makes accurate analysis of results from a small number of electrodes difficult and unreliable. Identifying zones with specific impedances can provide greater certainty regarding the factors behind the impedance. Conventional Four Electrode or Tetra-polar Impedance Measurement (TPIM) is simple, but the zone of sensitivity is not well defined and may include organs other that those of interest, making interpretation difficult and unreliable. On the other hand, Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) offers reasonable resolution, but is complex and require many electrodes. By placing two FEIM systems perpendicular to each other over a common zone at the center and combining the results, it is possible to obtain enhanced sensitivity over this central zone. This is the basis of FIM, which may be useful for impedance measurements of large organs like stomach, heart, and lungs. Being much simpler in comparison to EIT, multifrequency systems can be simply built for FIM. FIM may be useful in other fields where impedance measurements are performed, like geology.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Experiment105798043 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/HigherCognitiveProcess105770664 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Inquiry105797597 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Measurement100996969 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ProblemSolving105796750 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Process105701363 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thinking105770926 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Trial105799212 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatImpedanceMeasurements | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTests | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/TopicalConcept

This does not apply on older devices, details for medical professionals are provided by the device's manufacturer. Certain atomic nuclei are able to absorb and emit radio frequency energy when placed in an external magnetic field. In clinical and research MRI, hydrogen atoms are most often used to generate a detectable radio-frequency signal that is received by antennas in close proximity to the anatomy being examined. Hydrogen atoms are naturally abundant in people and other biological organisms, particularly in water and fat. For this reason, most MRI scans essentially map the location of water and fat in the body. Pulses of radio waves excite the nuclear spin energy transition, and magnetic field gradients localize the signal in space. By varying the parameters of the pulse sequence, different contrasts may be generated between tissues based on the relaxation properties of the hydrogen atoms therein. When inside the magnetic field (B0) of the scanner, the magnetic moments of the protons align to be either parallel or anti-parallel to the direction of the field. While each individual proton can only have one of two alignments, the collection of protons appear to behave as though they can have any alignment. Most protons align parallel to B0 as this is a lower energy state. A radio frequency pulse is then applied, which can excite protons from parallel to anti-parallel alignment, only the latter are relevant to the rest of the discussion. In response to the force bringing them back to their equilibrium orientation, the protons undergo a rotating motion (precession), much like a spun wheel under the effect of gravity. The protons will return to the low energy state by the process of spin-lattice relaxation. This appears as a magnetic flux, which yields a changing voltage in receiver coils to give the signal. The frequency at which a proton or group of protons in a voxel resonates depends on the strength of the local magnetic field around the proton or group of protons, a stronger field corresponds to a larger energy difference and higher frequency photons. By applying additional magnetic fields (gradients) that vary linearly over space, specific slices to be imaged can be selected, and an image is obtained by taking the 2-D Fourier transform of the spatial frequencies of the signal (k-space). Due to the magnetic Lorentz force from B0 on the current flowing in the gradient coils, the gradient coils will try to move producing loud knocking sounds, for which patients require hearing protection.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Magnetic_resonance_imaging,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/TopicalConcept | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

In other words this is an alternative to Lasik. IOLs usually consist of a small plastic lens with plastic side struts, called haptics, to hold the lens in place in the capsular bag inside the eye. IOLs were conventionally made of an inflexible material (PMMA), although this has largely been superseded by the use of flexible materials, such as silicone and acrylic glass. Most IOLs fitted today are fixed monofocal lenses matched to distance vision. However, other types are available, such as multifocal IOLs that provide the patient with multiple-focused vision at far and reading distance, and adaptive IOLs that provide the patient with limited visual accommodation. can further be Multifocal IOLs, Trifocal IOLs or EDOF lenses. EDOF stands for extended depth of focus lenses. Surgeons annually implant more than 6 million lenses. The procedure can be done under local anesthesia or topical anesthesia with the patient awake throughout the operation. The use of a flexible IOL enables the lens to be rolled for insertion into the capsular bag through a very small incision, thus avoiding the need for stitches. This procedure usually takes less than 30 minutes in the hands of an experienced ophthalmologist. The recovery period is about 2–3 weeks. After surgery, patients should avoid strenuous exercise or anything else that significantly increases blood pressure. They should visit their ophthalmologists regularly for 3 weeks to monitor the implants. IOL implantation carries several risks associated with eye surgeries, such as infection, loosening of the lens, lens rotation, inflammation and nighttime halos, but a systematic review of studies has determined that the procedure is safer than conventional laser eye treatment. Though IOLs enable many patients to have reduced dependence on glasses, most patients still rely on glasses for certain activities, such as reading. These reading glasses can be avoided if Multifocal IOLs, Trifocal IOLs or EDOF lenses are used.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Attribute100024264 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Condition113920835 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Disorder114052403 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalCondition114034177 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/State100024720 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDisordersOfLens | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Because the pacemaker potential represents the non-contracting time between heart beats (diastole), it is also called the diastolic depolarization.The amount of net inward current required to move the cell membrane potential during the pacemaker phase is extremely small, in the order of few pAs, but this net flux arises from time to time changing contribution of several currents that flow with different voltage and time dependence. Evidence in support of the active presence of K+, Ca2+, Na+ channels and Na+/K+ exchanger during the pacemaker phase have been variously reported in the literature, but several indications point to the “funny”(If) current as one of the most important.(see funny current). There is now substantial evidence that also sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-transients participate to the generation of the diastolic depolarization via a process involving the Na–Ca exchanger.

It should not be confused with defibrillation (used in more serious cases, in ventricular fibrillation and other shockable rhythms) using a manual or automatic defibrillator, though some newer defibrillators can do both, and pads and an electrical stimulus to the heart are used in transcutaneous pacing and defibrillation. Transcutaneous pacing is accomplished by delivering pulses of electric current through the patient's chest, which stimulates the heart to contract. The most common indication for transcutaneous pacing is an abnormally slow heart rate. By convention, a heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute in the adult patient is called bradycardia. Not all instances of bradycardia require medical treatment. Normal heart rate varies substantially between individuals, and many athletes in particular have a relatively slow resting heart rate. In addition, the heart rate is known to naturally slow with age. It is only when bradycardia presents with signs and symptoms of shock that it requires emergency treatment with transcutaneous pacing. Some common causes of hemodynamically significant bradycardia include myocardial infarction, sinus node dysfunction and complete heart block. Transcutaneous pacing is no longer indicated for the treatment of asystole (cardiac arrest associated with a ""flat line"" on the ECG), with the possible exception of witnessed asystole (as in the case of bifascicular block that progresses to complete heart block without an escape rhythm). During transcutaneous pacing, pads are placed on the patient's chest, either in the anterior/lateral position or the anterior/posterior position. The anterior/posterior position is preferred as it minimizes transthoracic electrical impedance by ""sandwiching"" the heart between the two pads. The pads are then attached to a monitor/defibrillator, a heart rate is selected, and current (measured in milliamps) is increased until electrical capture (characterized by a wide QRS complex with tall, broad T wave on the ECG) is obtained, with a corresponding pulse. Pacing artifact on the ECG and severe muscle twitching may make this determination difficult. It is therefore advisable to use another instrument (e.g. SpO2 monitor or bedside doppler) to confirm mechanical capture. Transcutaneous pacing may be uncomfortable for the patient. Sedation should therefore be considered. Before pacing the patient in a prehospital setting sedation is recommended by administering an analgesic or an anxiolytic. Prolonged transcutaneous pacing may cause burns on the skin. According to the Zoll M Series Operator's Guide,"" Continuous pacing of neonates can cause skin burns. If it is necessary to pace for more than 30 minutes, periodic inspection of the underlying skin is strongly advised."" It is meant to stabilize the patient until a more permanent means of pacing is achieved. Other forms of cardiac pacing are transvenous pacing, epicardial pacing, and permanent pacing with an implantable pacemaker. In addition to synchronized transcutaneous pacing offered by newer cardiac monitor/defibrillators, there is also an option for asynchronous pacing. Sometimes in the prehospital setting a situation may arise where ECG electrodes are not available or something interferes with their adhesion to the patient's skin. In these rare situations where the patient must be paced and there are no other alternatives, asynchronous pacing may be used. Again, this setting should only be used as a last resort due to possible adverse cardiac effects it could cause.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cardiac_electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MedicalProcedure101024392 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatEmergencyMedicalProcedures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Software

It has an additional use in gastric variceal obliteration as a dilutant that does not affect polymerization of cyanoacrylate. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the use of Lipiodol as a therapeutic agent in the management of unexplained infertility, using a procedure called Lipiodol flushing. There have been a small number of studies that suggest that flushing the media through the tubes gives a short-term rise in fecundity in patients with unexplained infertility. A systematic review has suggested a significant increase in fertility, especially in those women who have endometriosis when using Lipiodol flushing. Historically Lipiodol was often used as a contrast medium at hysterosalpingography (HSG: a procedure to determine tubal patency, used in the investigation of subfertility). It became less commonly utilized in the 1960s to 1980s because the more modern water-soluble media give images that are easier to interpret. There is also an important safety issue with Lipiodol in that intravasation (leakage) of the fluid into the venous system has caused complications in the past. Ethiodized oil is composed of iodine combined with ethyl esters of fatty acids of poppyseed oil, primarily as ethyl monoiodostearate and ethyl diiodostearate. The precise structure is not known. Lipiodol was first synthesized by Marcel Guerbet in the Paris School of Pharmacy in 1901.

Fibrin consists of the blood proteins fibrinogen and thrombin which participate in blood clotting. Fibrin glue or fibrin sealant is also referred to as a fibrin based scaffold and used to control surgical bleeding, speed wound healing, seal off hollow body organs or cover holes made by standard sutures, and provide slow-release delivery of medications like antibiotics to tissues exposed. Fibrin scaffold use is helpful in repairing injuries to the urinary tract, liver lung, spleen, kidney, and heart. In biomedical research, fibrin scaffolds have been used to fill bone cavities, repair neurons, heart valves, vascular grafts and the surface of the eye. The complexity of biological systems requires customized care to sustain their function. When they are no longer able to perform their purpose, interference of new cells and biological cues is provided by a scaffold material. Fibrin scaffold has many aspects like being biocompatible, biodegradable and easily processable. Furthermore, it has an autologous nature and it can be manipulated in various size and shape. Inherent role in wound healing is helpful in surgical applications. Many factors can be bound to fibrin scaffold and those can be released in a cell-controlled manner. Its stiffness can be managed by changing the concentration according to needs of surrounding or encapsulated cells. Additional mechanical properties can be obtained by combining fibrin with other suitable scaffolds.

It is most effective when used in both ears.Delayed auditory feedback devices are used in speech perception experiments in order to demonstrate the importance of auditory feedback in speech perception as well as in speech production. Delayed auditory feedback has been used with a directional microphone and speaker to create a device intended to silence an individual speaker using the mental stress induced in people not used to the effect.

Some VADs are for short-term use, typically for patients recovering from myocardial infarction (heart attack) and for patients recovering from cardiac surgery; some are for long-term use (months to years to perpetuity), typically for patients suffering from advanced heart failure. VADs are designed to assist either the right ventricle (RVAD) or the left ventricle (LVAD), or to assist both ventricles (BiVAD). The type of VAD implanted depends on the type of underlying heart disease, and on the pulmonary arterial resistance, which determines the workload of the right ventricle. The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is the most common device applied to a defective heart (it is sufficient in most cases; the right side of the heart is then often able to make use of the heavily increased blood flow), but when the pulmonary arterial resistance is high, then an (additional) right ventricular assist device (RVAD) might be necessary to resolve the problem of cardiac circulation. If both an LVAD and an RVAD is needed a BiVAD is normally used, rather than a separate LVAD and RVAD. Normally, the long-term VAD is used as a bridge to transplantation (BTT) — keeping the patient alive, and in reasonably good condition, and able to await heart transplant outside of the hospital.Other ""bridges"" include bridge to candidacy, bridge to decision, and bridge to recovery.In some instances VADs are also used as destination therapy (DT). In this instance, the patient will not undergo a heart transplantation and will rely on the VAD for the remainder of his or her life.

In non-valvular AF, over 90% of stroke-causing clots that come from the heart are formed in the left atrial appendage. The most common treatment for AF stroke risk is treatment with blood-thinning medications, also called oral anticoagulants, which reduce the chance for blood clots to form. These medications (which include warfarin, and other newer approved blood thinners) are very effective in lowering the risk of stroke in AF patients. Most patients can safely take these medications for years (and even decades) without serious side effects. However, some patients find that blood thinning medications can be difficult to tolerate or are risky. Because they prevent blood clots by thinning the blood, blood thinners can increase the risk of bleeding problems. In select patients, physicians determine that an alternative to blood thinners is needed to reduce AF stroke risk. Approximately 45% of patients who are eligible for warfarin are not being treated, due to tolerance or adherence issues. This applies particularly to the elderly, although studies have indicated that they can also benefit from anticoagulants. Left atrial appendage closure is an implant-based alternative to blood thinners. Like blood thinning medications, an LAAC implant does not cure AF. A stroke can be due to factors not related to a clot traveling to the brain from the left atrium. Other causes of stroke can include high blood pressure and narrowing of the blood vessels to the brain. An LAAC implant will not prevent these other causes of stroke.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/VideoGame

CI bypasses the normal acoustic hearing process to replace it with electric signals which directly stimulate the auditory nerve. A person with a cochlear implant receiving intensive auditory training may learn to interpret those signals as sound and speech. However, one-third of deaf children do not develop language if they are on a CI program alone and have no sign language input. The implant has two main components. The outside component is generally worn behind the ear, but could also be attached to clothing, for example, in young children. This component, the sound processor, contains microphones, electronics that include digital signal processor (DSP) chips, battery, and a coil that transmits a signal to the implant across the skin. The inside component, the actual implant, has a coil to receive signals, electronics, and an array of electrodes which is placed into the cochlea, which stimulate the cochlear nerve. The surgical procedure is performed under general anesthesia. Surgical risks are minimal but can include tinnitus, facial nerve bruising and dizziness. From the early days of implants in the 1970s and the 1980s, speech perception via an implant has steadily increased. Many users of modern implants gain reasonable to good hearing and speech perception skills post-implantation, especially when combined with lipreading. However, for pre-lingually deaf children the risk of not acquiring spoken language even with an implant may be as high as 30%. One of the challenges that remain with these implants is that hearing and speech understanding skills after implantation show a wide range of variation across individual implant users. Factors such as duration and cause of hearing loss, how the implant is situated in the cochlea, the overall health of the cochlear nerve, but also individual capabilities of re-learning are considered to contribute to this variation, yet no certain predictive factors are known. Despite providing the ability for hearing and oral speech communication to children and adults with severe to profound hearing loss, there is also controversy around the devices. Much of the strongest objection to cochlear implants has come from the Deaf community. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which as some view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine) | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_devices | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroprosthetics,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ability105616246 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Application100949134 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Creativity105624700 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Invention105633385 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Occupation100582388 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Profession100609953 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Technology100949619 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Use100947128 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatAustralianInventions | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatNASASpin-offTechnologies | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

* LF-CDI, low-frequency CDI, the original implementation developed at the University of Toronto. In this technique, low frequency (LF) electric currents are injected into the tissue. These currents generate magnetic fields, which are then measured using MRI techniques. The current pathways are then computed and spatially mapped. 
* RF-CDI, radio frequency CDI, a rotating frame of reference version of LF-CDI. This allows measurement of a single component of current density, without requiring subject rotation.

Elastomeric pumps do not require any electricity and are not gravity driven. When placed above or below the patient, flow rate is typically increased or decreased slightly (head height effect). Filling the pump is done manually through a one-way valve using a syringe or peristaltic repeater pump. Elastomeric pumps are maintenance free and run independently without any electronics, and are single-use disposable. Depending on the pump's size the drug inside the pump can be delivered over a time spread varying between thirty minutes to seven days. This type of pump is ideal for outpatients or patients that require a high level of mobility.

MRI does not involve X-rays or the use of ionizing radiation, which distinguishes it from CT and PET scans. MRI is a medical application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) which can also be used for imaging in other NMR applications, such as NMR spectroscopy. While the hazards of ionizing radiation are now well controlled in most medical contexts, an MRI may still be seen as a better choice than a CT scan. MRI is widely used in hospitals and clinics for medical diagnosis and staging and follow-up of disease without exposing the body to radiation. An MRI may yield different information compared with CT. Risks and discomfort may be associated with MRI scans. Compared with CT scans, MRI scans typically take longer and are louder, and they usually need the subject to enter a narrow, confining tube. In addition, people with some medical implants or other non-removable metal inside the body may be unable to undergo an MRI examination safely. MRI was originally called NMRI (nuclear magnetic resonance imaging), but ""nuclear"" was dropped to avoid negative associations. Certain atomic nuclei are able to absorb radio frequency energy when placed in an external magnetic field; the resultant evolving spin polarization can induce a RF signal in a radio frequency coil and thereby be detected. In clinical and research MRI, hydrogen atoms are most often used to generate a macroscopic polarization that is detected by antennae close to the subject being examined. Hydrogen atoms are naturally abundant in humans and other biological organisms, particularly in water and fat. For this reason, most MRI scans essentially map the location of water and fat in the body. Pulses of radio waves excite the nuclear spin energy transition, and magnetic field gradients localize the polarization in space. By varying the parameters of the pulse sequence, different contrasts may be generated between tissues based on the relaxation properties of the hydrogen atoms therein. Since its development in the 1970s and 1980s, MRI has proven to be a versatile imaging technique. While MRI is most prominently used in diagnostic medicine and biomedical research, it also may be used to form images of non-living objects. Diffusion MRI and Functional MRI extends the utility of MRI to capture neuronal tracts and blood flow respectively in the nervous system, in addition to detailed spatial images. The sustained increase in demand for MRI within health systems has led to concerns about cost effectiveness and overdiagnosis.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Magnetic_resonance_imaging | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/TopicalConcept | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Patch clamping can be performed using the voltage clamp technique. In this case, the voltage across the cell membrane is controlled by the experimenter and the resulting currents are recorded. Alternatively, the current clamp technique can be used. In this case, the current passing across the membrane is controlled by the experimenter and the resulting changes in voltage are recorded, generally in the form of action potentials. Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann developed the patch clamp in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This discovery made it possible to record the currents of single ion channel molecules for the first time, which improved understanding of the involvement of channels in fundamental cell processes such as action potentials and nerve activity.

L-type calcium channels are responsible for the excitation-contraction coupling of skeletal, smooth, cardiac muscle, and for aldosterone secretion in endocrine cells of the adrenal cortex. They are also found in neurons, and with the help of L-type calcium channels in endocrine cells, they regulate neurohormones and neurotransmitters. They have also been seen to play a role in gene expression, mRNA stability, neuronal survival, ischemic-induced axonal injury, synaptic efficacy, and both activation and deactivation of other ion channels. In cardiac myocytes, the L-type calcium channel passes inward Ca2+ current and triggers calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by activating ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) (calcium-induced-calcium-release). Phosphorylation of these channels increases their permeability to calcium and increases the contractility of their respective cardiac myocytes.

The relevant variable is the membrane potential, x(t), which is written in dimensionless units. There are two more variables, y(t) and z(t), which take into account the transport of ions across the membrane through the ion channels. The transport of sodium and potassium ions is made through fast ion channels and its rate is measured by y(t), which is called the spiking variable. z(t) corresponds to an adaptation current, which is incremented at every spike, leading to a decrease in the firing rate. Then, the Hindmarsh–Rose model has the mathematical form of a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations on the dimensionless dynamical variables x(t), y(t), and z(t). They read: where The model has eight parameters: a, b, c, d, r, s, xR and I. It is common to fix some of them and let the others be control parameters. Usually the parameter I, which means the current that enters the neuron, is taken as a control parameter. Other control parameters used often in the literature are a, b, c, d, or r, the first four modeling the working of the fast ion channels and the last one the slow ion channels, respectively. Frequently, the parameters held fixed are s = 4 and xR = -8/5. When a, b, c, d are fixed the values given are a = 1, b = 3, c = 1, and d = 5. The parameter r governs the time scale of the neural adaptation and is something of the order of 10−3, and I ranges between −10 and 10. The third state equation: allows a great variety of dynamic behaviors of the membrane potential, described by variable x, including unpredictable behavior, which is referred to as chaotic dynamics. This makes the Hindmarsh–Rose model relatively simple and provides a good qualitative description of the many different patterns that are observed empirically.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Attribute100024264 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/DynamicalSystem106246361 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Group100031264 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/NonlinearSystem108435246 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhaseSpace100029114 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Space100028651 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/System108435388 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDynamicalSystems | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatNonlinearSystems

In some cases it may be downsized gradually so that tissue can strengthen over time and compensate for the decreasing size of the obturator.

It raises the palate and reduces the range of movement necessary to provide adequate closure to separate the nasal cavity from the oral cavity. and palatal lifts aid in and do not obturate a fistula.

Freely moving animals may turn through several revolutions in one direction. While recording from freely moving animals, therefore, an electrical commutator is needed to prevent twisting of the wires that go from the electrode (moving and rotating with the head) to the amplifier/recorder (fixed to the ground). Traditional electrical commutators use slip rings for coupling. Slip rings however inject into the connection. This is because as the contact points slide over the surface of the slip-rings they make microscopic bumps. The resultant variation in resistance and inductance causes electrical noise in the circuit. To reduce the electrical noise the contact points need to be pressed against the slip rings with greater force. This leads to great resistance and a higher rate of wear. Replacing the slip rings with pools of mercury — a conducting fluid — reduces commutator noise and friction, enabling commutator use for small weaker animals. OEM machinery manufacturers are discovering the benefits of using a mercury swivel commutator in their designs. For example packaging machines use some type of commutator or slip ring as a connection to the moving parts that are heated to seal the packages closed after they are filled. It is critical that the temperature sensing circuit be reliable and accurate. Unfortunately, using a slip ring assembly or standard electrical slip ring may cause problems due to electrical noise and degradation of signal produced by the rubbing contacts of the slip rings. Many OEM machinery manufacturers have switched to using mercury swivel commutators for reliable and accurate temperature control.

The biological pacemaker is intended as an alternative to the artificial cardiac pacemaker that has been in human use since the late 1950s. Despite their success, several limitations and problems with artificial pacemakers have emerged during the past decades such as electrode fracture or damage to insulation, infection, re-operations for battery exchange, and venous thrombosis. The need for an alternative is most obvious in children, including premature newborn babies, where size mismatch and the fact that pacemaker leads do not grow with children are a problem.

Changes in the normal ECG pattern occur in numerous cardiac abnormalities, including cardiac rhythm disturbances (such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia), inadequate coronary artery blood flow (such as myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction), and electrolyte disturbances (such as hypokalemia and hyperkalemia). In a conventional 12-lead ECG, ten electrodes are placed on the patient's limbs and on the surface of the chest. The overall magnitude of the heart's electrical potential is then measured from twelve different angles (""leads"") and is recorded over a period of time (usually ten seconds). In this way, the overall magnitude and direction of the heart's electrical depolarization is captured at each moment throughout the cardiac cycle. There are three main components to an ECG: the P wave, which represents the depolarization of the atria; the QRS complex, which represents the depolarization of the ventricles; and the T wave, which represents the repolarization of the ventricles. During each heartbeat, a healthy heart has an orderly progression of depolarization that starts with pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node, spreads throughout the atrium, and passes through the atrioventricular node down into the bundle of His and into the Purkinje fibers, spreading down and to the left throughout the ventricles. This orderly pattern of depolarization gives rise to the characteristic ECG tracing. To the trained clinician, an ECG conveys a large amount of information about the structure of the heart and the function of its electrical conduction system. Among other things, an ECG can be used to measure the rate and rhythm of heartbeats, the size and position of the heart chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart's muscle cells or conduction system, the effects of heart drugs, and the function of implanted pacemakers.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cardiac_electrophysiology | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Election | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

This work has been expanded to include professional Football, Baseball, and Ice Hockey teams as well as the Winter and Summer Olympic Games in collaboration with investigators such as Marnix Van Holsbeeck. Dr. Dulchavsky has also led an innovative pilot study to expand comprehensive ultrasound education to basic science medical students at the Wayne State University School of Medicine.

They consist of a gelatin based shell surrounding a liquid fill. Softgel shells are a combination of gelatin, water, opacifier and a plasticiser such as glycerin or sorbitol. Softgels are produced in a process known as encapsulation using the Rotary Die Encapsulation process invented by Robert Pauli Scherer. The encapsulation process has been described as a form/fill/seal process. Two flat ribbons of shell material are manufactured on the machine and brought together on a twin set of rotating dies. The dies contain recesses in the desired size and shape, which cut out the ribbons into a two-dimensional shape, and form a seal around the outside. At the same time a pump delivers a precise dose of fill material through a nozzle incorporated into a filling wedge whose tip sits between the two ribbons in between two die pockets at the point of cut out. The wedge is heated to facilitate the sealing process. The wedge injection causes the two flat ribbons to expand into the die pockets, giving rise to the three-dimensional finished product. After encapsulation, the softgels are dried for two days to two weeks depending on the product.

R.H. Mole proposed the term “abscopal” (‘ab’ - away from, ‘scopus’ - target) in 1953 to refer to effects of ionizing radiation “at a distance from the irradiated volume but within the same organism.” Initially associated with single-tumor, localized radiation therapy, the term “abscopal effect” has also come to encompass other types of localized treatments such as electroporation and intra-tumoral injection of therapeutics. However, the term should only be used when truly local treatments result in systemic effects. For instance, chemotherapeutics commonly circulate through the blood stream and therefore exclude the possibility of any abscopal response. The mediators of the abscopal effect of radiotherapy were unknown for decades. In 2004, it was postulated for the first time that the immune system might be responsible for these “off-target” anti-tumor effects. Various studies in animal models of melanoma, mammary, and colorectal tumors have substantiated this hypothesis. Abscopal effects of Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy have been seen in clinical studies, including in randomized trials where women treated with lumpectomy for breast cancer combined with whole breast radiotherapy showed reduced mortality from non-breast-cancer causes when compared with whole breast radiotherapy. Furthermore, immune-mediated abscopal effects were also described in patients with metastatic cancer. Whereas these reports were extremely rare throughout the 20th century, the clinical use of immune checkpoint blocking antibodies such as ipilimumab or pembrolizumab has greatly increased the number of abscopally responding patients in selected groups of patients such as those with metastatic melanoma.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiation_therapy,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Care100654885 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Treatment100658082 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCancerTreatments | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTreatments | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Work100575741 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Disease

There are generally considered to be three types of unsharpness: geometric unsharpness, motion unsharpness and photographic or system unsharpness.",literal,en,"Unsharpness is the loss of spatial resolution in a radiographic image. There are generally considered to be three types of unsharpness: geometric unsharpness, motion unsharpness and photographic or system unsharpness. Motion unsharpness is caused by movement of the patient, the detector or the source of X-rays, during the exposure. Movement of the patient, either voluntary or otherwise, is the most common cause and this can be minimised in a number of ways: immobilizing the patient, asking the patient to keep still or to hold the breath and keeping exposure time short, and thereby giving them less time in which to move, are the most obvious. System unsharpness (previously called photographic unsharpnesss) is the result of the detector system employed. Every detector type has a limiting factor which determines its maximum spatial resolution. In film systems it is the size of the grains of photographic chemical. In computed radiography systems it the size of the laser used to read the phosphor plate in the cassette reader. In digital radiography systems it is the size of the individual thin film transistors. Since each type has a maximum capability, there is no way to minimise this system other than using a better and probably more expensive machine. Geometric unsharpness is caused by aspects of the geometry of the X-ray beam. Two principal factors play simultaneously: the apparent focal spot size and the ratio between object-film distance (OFD) and focus-film distance (FFD). Fine focal spot sizes will minimise geometric unsharpness, and therefore give more detailed images, but it is often impossible to employ them due to the tube loading necessary in the exposure. Keeping the ratio FFD:OFD high will minimise geometric unsharpness. This is most easily done by keeping the OFD to a minimum, i.e., keeping the part of the body being X-rayed as close to the detector as possible. If this is not possible however, then increasing FFD beyond the normal 100–110 cm will be necessary to keep the unsharpness level acceptable.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiography,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Disease

Large centrifuges are used to simulate high gravity or acceleration environments (for example, high-G training for test pilots). Medium-sized centrifuges are used in washing machines and at some swimming pools to draw water out of fabrics.

The company was known as Watson & Son (X-Ray) Ltd. until the merger in the late 1960s with A. E. Dean and Co. of Croydon. Watson and Sons had originally manufactured microscopes and other optical instruments, but in the late 19th century had seen the opportunity of making X-Ray equipment. They became part of GEC in the very early part of the 20th century. The main business of the merged GEC Medical was the manufacture of X-Ray equipment, including X-Ray tubes which were made under licence from a US company called Machlett Laboratories. Other products were the high voltage supplies needed for X-Ray tubes, the tables for positioning patients and many other accessories. It also employed a fairly large number of people supplying spare parts and servicing the pieces of equipment that were sold by the company. In the late 1980s the company introduced the concept of using a higher than mains frequency in an X-Ray power supply. One of the last products made by the company before it closed was a mammography unit.

The focometer is monocular and hand-held, and is normally used in natural lighting. Patients rotate a collar on the focometer until the best focus is achieved. The individual's refractive power is then read off a linear dioptre scale. The focometer was developed by Drs. Ian Berger and Larry Spitzberg at the University of Houston College of Optometry in Houston, Texas, to provide a simple, inexpensive means for measuring refractive error in human vision. The portable, hand-held instrument is highly appropriate for use in remote and poor areas. Focometers measure spherical refractive errors. Astigmatism can also be measured using a ""clock target"" with the device. A study has found, however, that the focometer is less effective for identifying astigmatism than an autorefractor, and that its axis accuracy is limited to 15°. The advantages of a focometer over other methods for use in developing countries are that it is lightweight, compact, relatively inexpensive, fairly quick, and easy to use with minimal training. A clinical trial compared the repeatability, validity, and ease of use of the focometer with an autorefractor. It found that the focometer results were within 0.75 dioptres of the autorefractor value 84% of the time. The authors found that repeatability of the measurements improved when patients were allowed to ""practice"" twice on each eye before taking the real reading.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Ophthalmic_equipment,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Chemical114806838 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatPhotographicChemicals | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent

It is commonly employed in delivery systems of intravenous therapy and acts to prevent air embolism. The use of a drip chamber also allows an estimate of the rate at which fluid is administered. For a fluid of a given viscosity, drips from a hole of known size will be of nearly identical volume, and the number of drips in a minute can be counted to gauge the rate of flow. In this instance the rate of flow is usually controlled by a clamp on the infusion tubing; this affects the resistance to flow. However, other sources of resistance (such as whether the vein is kinked or compressed by the patient's position) cannot be so directly controlled and a change in position may change the rate of flow leading to inadvertently rapid or slow infusion. Where this might be problematic an infusion pump can be used which gives a more accurate measurement of flow rate. Drip chambers can be classified into macro-drip (about 10 to 20 gtts/ml) and micro-drip (about 60 gtts/ml) based on their drop factors. For a given drip chamber (when the fluid drips from the hole into the chamber) drop factor means number of drops per ml of the IV fluid. Flow rate can be calculated with the help of the observations from the drip chamber and its drop factor. The unit of flow rate is gtts/min, where gtts means guttae (Latin plural noun meaning “drops”).

Action potentials occur in several types of animal cells, called excitable cells, which include neurons, muscle cells, endocrine cells and in some plant cells. In neurons, action potentials play a central role in cell-to-cell communication by providing for—or with regard to saltatory conduction, assisting—the propagation of signals along the neuron's axon toward synaptic boutons situated at the ends of an axon; these signals can then connect with other neurons at synapses, or to motor cells or glands. In other types of cells, their main function is to activate intracellular processes. In muscle cells, for example, an action potential is the first step in the chain of events leading to contraction. In beta cells of the pancreas, they provoke release of insulin. Action potentials in neurons are also known as ""nerve impulses"" or ""spikes"", and the temporal sequence of action potentials generated by a neuron is called its ""spike train"". A neuron that emits an action potential, or nerve impulse, is often said to ""fire"". Action potentials are generated by special types of voltage-gated ion channels embedded in a cell's plasma membrane. These channels are shut when the membrane potential is near the (negative) resting potential of the cell, but they rapidly begin to open if the membrane potential increases to a precisely defined threshold voltage, depolarising the transmembrane potential. When the channels open, they allow an inward flow of sodium ions, which changes the electrochemical gradient, which in turn produces a further rise in the membrane potential towards zero. This then causes more channels to open, producing a greater electric current across the cell membrane and so on. The process proceeds explosively until all of the available ion channels are open, resulting in a large upswing in the membrane potential. The rapid influx of sodium ions causes the polarity of the plasma membrane to reverse, and the ion channels then rapidly inactivate. As the sodium channels close, sodium ions can no longer enter the neuron, and they are then actively transported back out of the plasma membrane. Potassium channels are then activated, and there is an outward current of potassium ions, returning the electrochemical gradient to the resting state. After an action potential has occurred, there is a transient negative shift, called the afterhyperpolarization. In animal cells, there are two primary types of action potentials. One type is generated by voltage-gated sodium channels, the other by voltage-gated calcium channels. Sodium-based action potentials usually last for under one millisecond, but calcium-based action potentials may last for 100 milliseconds or longer. In some types of neurons, slow calcium spikes provide the driving force for a long burst of rapidly emitted sodium spikes. In cardiac muscle cells, on the other hand, an initial fast sodium spike provides a ""primer"" to provoke the rapid onset of a calcium spike, which then produces muscle contraction.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/SportsEvent | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Siemens uses the name FLASH, General Electric used the name SPGR (Spoiled Gradient Echo), and Philips uses the name CE-FFE-T1 (Contrast-Enhanced Fast Field Echo) or T1-FFE. Depending on the desired contrast, the generic FLASH technique provides spoiled versions that destroy transverse coherences and yield T1 contrast as well as refocused versions (constant phase per repetition) and fully balanced versions (zero phase per repetition) that incorporate transverse coherences into the steady-state signal and offer T1/T2 contrast.

* dynamic acquisitions synchronized to the electrocardiogram generate movies of the beating heart,

It can be used to treat symptomatic bradycardias that do not respond to transcutaneous pacing or to drug therapy. Transvenous pacing is achieved by threading a pacing electrode through a vein into the right atrium, right ventricle, or both. This means of pacing the heart is not as popular as other means of pacing (see transcutaneous pacing, implanted pacemaker, ) because it is a temporary solution to pace the heart and yet involves a similar level of risk of bleeding as a more permanent solution like placing an implanted pacemaker. For patients who present in an emergency setting with symptomatic bradycardias, usually drugs like atropine or sympathomimetic drugs (epinephrine or dopamine) can be used to increase the heart rate to an adequate level until the underlying cause of the bradycardia can be isolated and then, possibly, a permanent pacemaker can be placed. For patients for whom transvenous pacing is chosen, the procedure is done at the bedside with a local anesthetic alone or in conjunction with conscious sedation. The pacing electrode is advanced through the vein under fluoroscopic and electrocardiographic guidance. An x-ray after the procedure is always obtained to confirm placement of the pacing electrode. The greater use of atropine and epinephrine or external pacing may make transvenous pacing unnecessary by stabilizing patients early in the process of caring for the patient.

In general, cracks are hard to detect at an early stage, and manual intervention is required for periodic inspections and repairs. In contrast, self-healing materials counter degradation through the initiation of a repair mechanism that responds to the micro-damage. Some self-healing materials are classed as smart structures, and can adapt to various environmental conditions according to their sensing and actuation properties. Although the most common types of self-healing materials are polymers or elastomers, self-healing covers all classes of materials, including metals, ceramics, and cementitious materials. Healing mechanisms vary from an instrinsic repair of the material to the addition of a repair agent contained in a microscopic vessel. For a material to be strictly defined as autonomously self-healing, it is necessary that the healing process occurs without human intervention. Self-healing polymers may, however, activate in response to an external stimulus (light, temperature change, etc.) to initiate the healing processes. A material that can intrinsically correct damage caused by normal usage could prevent costs incurred by material failure and lower costs of a number of different industrial processes through longer part lifetime, and reduction of inefficiency caused by degradation over time.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSmartMaterials | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Company

Its atomic weight is 47.867 measured in daltons. It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength. Titanium is resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine. Titanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth after the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of mineral deposits, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere; it is found in almost all living things, as well as bodies of water, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene. Titanium can be alloyed with iron, aluminium, vanadium, and molybdenum, among other elements, to produce strong, lightweight alloys for aerospace (jet engines, missiles, and spacecraft), military, industrial processes (chemicals and petrochemicals, desalination plants, pulp, and paper), automotive, agriculture (farming), medical prostheses, orthopedic implants, dental and endodontic instruments and files, dental implants, sporting goods, jewelry, mobile phones, and other applications. The two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio, the highest of any metallic element. In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but less dense. There are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element, 46Ti through 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8%). Although titanium and zirconium have the same number of valence electrons and are in the same group in the periodic table, they differ in many chemical and physical properties.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/MilitaryUnit | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing

CBCT has become increasingly important in treatment planning and diagnosis in implant dentistry, ENT, orthopedics, and interventional radiology (IR), among other things. Perhaps because of the increased access to such technology, CBCT scanners are now finding many uses in dentistry, such as in the fields of oral surgery, endodontics and orthodontics. Integrated CBCT is also an important tool for patient positioning and verification in image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). During dental/orthodontic imaging, the CBCT scanner rotates around the patient's head, obtaining up to nearly 600 distinct images. For interventional radiology, the patient is positioned offset to the table so that the region of interest is centered in the field of view for the cone beam. A single 200 degree rotation over the region of interest acquires a volumetric data set. The scanning software collects the data and reconstructs it, producing what is termed a digital volume composed of three-dimensional voxels of anatomical data that can then be manipulated and visualized with specialized software. CBCT shares many similarities with traditional (fan beam) CT however there are important differences, particularly for reconstruction.

He became experienced in the radical extended Wertheim hysterectomy for treating cervical cancer, performing more than 500 of these in his lifetime. Personal tragedy directed Bonney towards conservative surgery and he became a pioneer in the field of the less drastic procedures of ovarian cystectomy for removing ovarian cysts and the myomectomy for removing uterine fibroids. Its preference over hysterectomy preserved the fertility of many women of reproductive age. He developed a surgical clamp to reduce post-myomectomy haemorrhage, established operative techniques to reduce post-operative haematomas and modified the Reverdin needle.

The ISO 15510 standard lists the chemical compositions of stainless steels of the specifications in existing ISO, ASTM, EN, JIS, and GB (Chinese) standards in a useful interchange table. Stainless steel's resistance to rusting results from the presence of chromium in the alloy, which forms a passive film that protects the underlying material from corrosion attack, and can self-heal in the presence of oxygen. Corrosion resistance can be increased further by the following means: 
* increase chromium content to more than 11% 
* add nickel to at least 8% 
* add molybdenum (which also improves resistance to pitting corrosion) The addition of nitrogen also improves resistance to pitting corrosion and increases mechanical strength. Thus, there are numerous grades of stainless steel with varying chromium and molybdenum contents to suit the environment the alloy must endure. Resistance to corrosion and staining, low maintenance, and familiar luster make stainless steel an ideal material for many applications where both the strength of steel and corrosion resistance are required. Moreover, stainless steel can be rolled into sheets, plates, bars, wire, and tubing. These can be used in cookware, cutlery, surgical instruments, major appliances, vehicles, construction material in large buildings, industrial equipment (e.g., in paper mills, chemical plants, water treatment), and storage tanks and tankers for chemicals and food products. The material's corrosion resistance, the ease with which it can be steam-cleaned and sterilized, and the absence of the need for surface coatings have prompted the use of stainless steel in kitchens and food processing plants.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Mineral | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Because many common and effective ingredients in toothpaste are harmful if swallowed in large doses and instead should be spat out, the act of brushing teeth is most often done at a sink within the kitchen or bathroom, where the brush may be rinsed off afterwards to remove any debris remaining and then dried to reduce conditions ideal for germ growth (and, if it is a wooden toothbrush, mold as well). Many toothbrushes have plant based handles, often bamboo. However, numerous others are made of cheap plastic; such brushes constitute a significant source of pollution.

It prevents airborne transmission of infections between patients and/or treating personnel by blocking the movement of pathogens (primarily bacteria and viruses) shed in respiratory droplets and aerosols into and from the wearer's mouth and nose. Typically quite impermeable to moisture, the mask act as an additional barrier for the airway and are not usually designed (unless N95-rated) to completely prevent the wearer from inhaling smaller airborne pathogens, but could be still protective by filtering out and trapping most of the droplets that carry them. There is a predominance of evidence that surgical masks protect both the wearer (by filtering the inhaled air) and bystanders (by blocking down forceful exhalations from the wearer that can spread pathogens afar). Surgical masks were originally designed to protect medical personnel from accidentally breathing or swallowing in splashes or sprays of bodily fluids, but the effectiveness of surgical masks against influenza-like infections has not been confirmed by high-quality randomized controlled trials. Commonly seen surgical masks vary greatly by quality and levels of protection. Despite their name, not all surgical masks are appropriate to be used during surgery. Surgical masks may be labeled as surgical, isolation, dental or medical procedure masks. Chinese health officials distinguish between medical (non-surgical) and surgical masks. Surgical masks are made of a nonwoven fabric created using a melt blowing process. They came into use in the 1960s and largely replaced cloth facemasks in developed countries. The dark blue (or green) side of the mask (the fluid-repellant layer) is to be worn outward, with the white (absorbent) layer on the inside. With respect to some infections like influenza surgical masks could be as effective (or ineffective) as respirators, such as N95 or FFP masks; though the latter provide better protection in laboratory experiments due to their material, shape and tight seal. The use of surgical masks during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a subject of debate, as mask shortage is a central issue.Surgical masks are popularly worn by the general public all year round in East Asian countries like China, Japan and South Korea, especially during allergy and flu seasons, to reduce the chance of spreading airborne diseases to others, and to prevent the breathing in of airborne irritants such as pollens or dust particles created by air pollution (though dust masks are more effective against pollution). Additionally, surgical masks have become a fashion statement, particularly in contemporary East Asian culture bolstered by its popularity in Japanese and Korean pop culture which have a big impact on East Asian youth culture.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_devices | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_masks,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Attire102756098 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Clothing103051540 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Commodity103076708 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ConsumerGoods103093574 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Covering103122748 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Disguise103206718 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Mask103724870 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMasks | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

But the two are correlated well enough that the safe, convenient, noninvasive, inexpensive pulse oximetry method is valuable for measuring oxygen saturation in clinical use. The most common approach is transmissive pulse oximetry. In this approach, a sensor device is placed on a thin part of the patient's body, usually a fingertip or earlobe, or an infant's foot. Fingertips and earlobes have higher blood flow rates than other tissues, which facilitates heat transfer. The device passes two wavelengths of light through the body part to a photodetector. It measures the changing absorbance at each of the wavelengths, allowing it to determine the absorbances due to the pulsing arterial blood alone, excluding venous blood, skin, bone, muscle, fat, and (in most cases) nail polish. Reflectance pulse oximetry is a less common alternative to transmissive pulse oximetry. This method does not require a thin section of the person's body and is therefore well suited to a universal application such as the feet, forehead, and chest, but it also has some limitations. Vasodilation and pooling of venous blood in the head due to compromised venous return to the heart can cause a combination of arterial and venous pulsations in the forehead region and lead to spurious SpO2 results.

While moving the streak or spot of light across the pupil the examiner observes the relative movement of the reflex or manually places lenses over the eye (using a trial frame and trial lenses) to ""neutralize"" the reflex. Static retinoscopy is a type of retinoscopy used in determining a patient's refractive error. It relies on Foucault knife-edge test, which states that the examiner should simulate optical infinity to obtain the correct refractive power. Hence, a power corresponding to the working distance is subtracted from the gross retinoscopy value to give the patient's refractive condition, the working distance lens being one which has a focal length of the examiner's distance from the patient (e.g. +1.50 dioptre lens for a 67 cm working distance). Myopes display an ""against"" reflex, which means that the direction of movement of light observed from the retina is a different direction to that in which the light beam is swept. Hyperopes, on the other hand, display a ""with"" movement, which means that the direction of movement of light observed from the retina is the same as that in which the light beam is swept. Static retinoscopy is performed when the patient has relaxed accommodative status. This can be obtained by the patient viewing a distance target or by the use of cycloplegic drugs (where, for example, a child's lack of reliable fixation of the target can lead to fluctuations in accommodation and thus the results obtained). Dynamic retinoscopy is performed when the patient has active accommodation from viewing a near target. Retinoscopy is particularly useful in prescribing corrective lenses for patients who are unable to undergo a subjective refraction that requires a judgement and response from the patient (such as children or those with severe intellectual disabilities or communication problems). In most tests however, it is used as a basis for further refinement by subjective refraction.

In diagnosis, it is used to create an image of internal body structures such as tendons, muscles, joints, blood vessels, and internal organs. Its aim is often to find a source of a disease or to exclude pathology. The practice of examining pregnant women using ultrasound is called obstetric ultrasound, and was an early development and application of clinical ultrasonography. Ultrasound is composed of sound waves with frequencies which are higher than the human range of hearing (>20,000 Hz). Ultrasonic images, also known as sonograms, are made by sending pulses of ultrasound into tissue using a probe. The ultrasound pulses echo off tissues with different reflection properties and are returned to the probe which records and displays them as an image. Many different types of images can be formed. The most common is a B-mode image (Brightness), which displays the acoustic impedance of a two-dimensional cross-section of tissue. Other types can display blood flow, motion of tissue over time, the location of blood, the presence of specific molecules, the stiffness of tissue, or the anatomy of a three-dimensional region. Compared to other common medical imaging modalities, ultrasound has several advantages. It provides images in real-time, is portable, and can be brought to the bedside. It is substantially lower in cost than other imaging strategies and does not use harmful ionizing radiation. Drawbacks include various limits on its field of view, the need for patient cooperation, dependence on physique, difficulty imaging structures obscured by bone and air or gases, and the necessity of a skilled operator, usually with professional training.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_imaging | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_ultrasonography,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ability105616246 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Creativity105624700 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Invention105633385 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatGermanInventions | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatScottishInventions | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSwedishInventions | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/TopicalConcept | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

The effective dose is not intended as a measure of deterministic health effects, which is the severity of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen, that is measured by the quantity absorbed dose. The concept of effective dose was developed by Wolfgang Jacobi and published in 1975, and was so convincing that the ICRP incorporated it into their 1977 general recommendations (publication 26) as ""effective dose equivalent"". The name ""effective dose"" replaced the name ""effective dose equivalent"" in 1991.

He went on to work at Queen Charlotte's Hospital in London, before being appointed Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at King's College Hospital, where he established a fetal medicine unit of international renown (now Harris-Birthright Research Centre for Fetal Medicine), where other leading fetal medicine practitioners such as Kypros Nicolaides, and Charles Rodeck would later train and work. Campbell's work went on to describe the use of ultrasound to diagnose fetal anomalies, and then the use of Doppler ultrasound, in particular uteroplacental Doppler, in the assessment of 'high-risk' pregnancies. Campbell went on to become Professor of Obstetrics & Gynaecology at St George's Hospital Medical School before his retirement. He was founding President of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology (ISUOG), and the first editor of the journal Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology (The White Journal), one of the leading peer-reviewed journals on imaging within obstetrics and gynaecology. In 1992 he was awarded the Ian Donald Gold Medal of ISUOG in recognition of his contribution to ultrasound in obstetrics & gynecology, with over 400 peer-reviewed publications to his name at the time. Since 2001 Campbell has been a consultant at CREATE Fertility, which was set up to provide the latest techniques in Reproductive Medicine, Antenatal and Gynaecological scanning. He has developed his interest in 3D and 4D (moving 3D) imaging and has published papers on a novel method of diagnosing cleft palate. In this work he collaborated with two colleagues at Addenbrookes Hospital, Christoph Lees ( Director of Fetal Medicine), who now has become Professor of Obstetrics and works at Queen Charlotte's Hospital, and Per Hall, oro-facial surgeon. The technique called the reverse face view provides detailed and reliable information on congenital defects of the fetal palate; hitherto only defects of the lips and alveolus could be visualised by existing techniques. He was also the first to describe patterns of fetal behaviour such as blinking, smiling, crying and reflexes in early pregnancy.

Primary beam radiation passes through the radiolucent strips as it travels roughly parallel to them, but scattered radiation which has, almost by definition, deviated from the parallel beam, cannot easily pass through the grid as it encounters the lead strips at an angle, and is attenuated, or lost, from the beam. Grids are used particularly in examinations where a large quantity of scatter is created, i.e., those involving a large volume of tissue being irradiated and those requiring low energy i.e. voltage. The scatter would otherwise degrade the image by reducing the contrast and resolution. Use of a grid, however, requires a greater radiation exposure to the patient as a good deal of primary beam is also attenuated by the lead slats, and for this reason grids are not used for all examinations. The single most important parameter that influences the performance of an anti-scatter grid, is the grid ratio. The grid ratio is the ratio of the height to the width of the interspaces (not the grid bars) in the grid. Grid ratios of 8:1, 10:1, and 12:1 are most common on radiography. A 5:1 grid is most common for mammography. The grid is essentially a one-dimensional Collimator and increasing the grid ratio increases the degree of collimation.

The Holter's most common use is for monitoring ECG heart activity (electrocardiography or ECG). Its extended recording period is sometimes useful for observing occasional cardiac arrhythmias which would be difficult to identify in a shorter period. For patients having more transient symptoms, a cardiac event monitor which can be worn for a month or more can be used. The Holter monitor was developed at the Holter Research Laboratory in Helena Montana by experimental physicists Norman J. Holter and Bill Glasscock, who started work on radio telemetry in 1949. Inspired by a suggestion from cardiologist Paul Dudley White in the early 1950s, they redirected their efforts toward development of a wearable cardiac monitoring device. The Holter monitor was released for commercial production in 1962. When used to study the heart, much like standard electrocardiography, the Holter monitor records electrical signals from the heart via a series of electrodes attached to the chest. Electrodes are placed over bones to minimize artifacts from muscular activity. The number and position of electrodes varies by model, but most Holter monitors employ between three and eight. These electrodes are connected to a small piece of equipment that is attached to the patient's belt or hung around the neck, keeping a log of the heart's electrical activity throughout the recording period. A 12-lead Holter system is also available when precise ECG signal information is required to analyse the exact nature and origin of the rhythm signal.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_monitoring_equipment,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ability105616246 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Creativity105624700 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Eponym106334985 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Invention105633385 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LanguageUnit106284225 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Name106333653 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatAmericanInventions | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCardiacProcedures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatEponyms | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Device

The excipients can include diluents, binders or granulating agents, glidants (flow aids) and lubricants to ensure efficient tabletting; disintegrants to promote tablet break-up in the digestive tract; sweeteners or flavours to enhance taste; and pigments to make the tablets visually attractive or aid in visual identification of an unknown tablet. A polymer coating is often applied to make the tablet smoother and easier to swallow, to control the release rate of the active ingredient, to make it more resistant to the environment (extending its shelf life), or to enhance the tablet's appearance. Medicinal tablets were originally made in the shape of a disk of whatever color their components determined, but are now made in many shapes and colors to help distinguish different medicines. Tablets are often stamped with symbols, letters, and numbers, which enable them to be identified. Sizes of tablets to be swallowed range from a few millimetres to about a centimetre. The compressed tablet is the most popular dosage form in use today. About two-thirds of all prescriptions are dispensed as solid dosage forms, and half of these are compressed tablets.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be used to image blood perfusion in organs, measure blood flow rate in the heart and other organs, and for other applications. Targeting ligands that bind to receptors characteristic of intravascular diseases can be conjugated to microbubbles, enabling the microbubble complex to accumulate selectively in areas of interest, such as diseased or abnormal tissues. This form of molecular imaging, known as targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound, will only generate a strong ultrasound signal if targeted microbubbles bind in the area of interest. Targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound may have many applications in both medical diagnostics and medical therapeutics. However, the targeted technique has not yet been approved by the FDA for clinical use in the United States. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is regarded as safe in adults, comparable to the safety of MRI contrast agents, and better than radiocontrast agents used in contrast CT scans.

In the case of post-synaptic neurons, the reversal potential is the membrane potential at which a given neurotransmitter causes no net current flow of ions through that neurotransmitter receptor's ion channel.",literal,en,"In a biological membrane, the reversal potential (also known as the Nernst potential) of an ion is the membrane potential at which there is no net (overall) flow of that particular ion from one side of the membrane to the other. In the case of post-synaptic neurons, the reversal potential is the membrane potential at which a given neurotransmitter causes no net current flow of ions through that neurotransmitter receptor's ion channel. In a single-ion system, reversal potential is synonymous with equilibrium potential; their numerical values are identical. The two terms refer to different aspects of the difference in membrane potential. Equilibrium refers to the fact that the net ion flux at a particular voltage is zero. That is, the outward and inward rates of ion movement are the same; the ion flux is in equilibrium. Reversal refers to the fact that a change of membrane potential on either side of the equilibrium potential reverses the overall direction of ion flux. The reversal potential is often called the ""Nernst potential"", as it can be calculated from the Nernst equation. Ion channels conduct most of the flow of simple ions in and out of cells. When a channel type that is selective to one species of ion dominates within the membrane of a cell (because other ion channels are closed, for example) then the voltage inside the cell will equilibrate (i.e. become equal) to the reversal potential for that ion (assuming the outside of the cell is at 0 volts). For example, the resting potential of most cells is close to the K+ (potassium ion) reversal potential. This is because at resting potential, potassium conductance dominates. During a typical action potential, the small resting ion conductance mediated by potassium channels is overwhelmed by the opening of numerous Na+ (sodium ion) channels, which brings the membrane potential towards the reversal potential of sodium. The relationship between the terms ""reversal potential"" and ""equilibrium potential"" only holds true for single-ion systems. In multi-ion systems, there are areas of the cell membrane where the summed currents of the multiple ions will equal zero. While this is a reversal potential in the sense that membrane potential reverses direction, it is not an equilibrium potential because not all (and in some cases, none) of the ions are in equilibrium and thus have net fluxes across the membrane. When a cell has significant permeabilities to more than one ion, the cell potential can be calculated from the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz equation rather than the Nernst equation.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cardiac_electrophysiology | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/AnatomicalStructure

That decreases risks, pain, and recovery compared to open procedures. Real-time visualization also allows precision guidance to the abnormality, making the procedure or diagnosis more accurate.

Vitallium was developed by Albert W. Merrick for the Austenal Laboratories in 1932. In 2016 Norman Sharp, a 91-year-old British man, was recognised as having the world's oldest hip replacement implants. The two Vitallium implants were implanted in November 1948 at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, under the newly formed NHS. The 67-year-old implants had such an unusually long life, partly because they had not required the typical replacement of such implants, but also because of Sharp's young age of 23 when they were implanted, owing to a childhood case of septic arthritis. For high-temperature use in engines, particularly turbochargers, the first alloy used was Haynes Stellite No. 21, similar to Vitallium. This was suggested by the British engineer, and denture wearer, S.D. Heron during World War II. Although the characteristics of the material obviously suggested itself for making turbocharger blades, it was thought impossible to cast it to the precision needed. Heron demonstrated that it could be, by showing his Vitallium dentures.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Biomaterials,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Alloy114586769 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Compound105870180 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Concept105835747 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Content105809192 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Idea105833840 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Mixture114586258 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole105869584 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatAlloys | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatChromiumAlloys | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatChromiumCompounds | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCobaltAlloys | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCobaltCompounds | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMolybdenumCompounds | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Company

The name ""Robstep"" is a portmanteau of the words ""robot"" and ""step"", meaning robotic steps. The devices have been compared to Segways. Computers and motors inside of the device keep the Robstep upright when powered on with balancing enabled. A user commands the Robstep to go forward by shifting their weight forward on the platform, and backward by shifting their weight backward. The Robstep detects, as it balances, the change in its center of mass, and first establishes and then maintains a corresponding speed, forward or backward. Gyroscopic sensors and fluid-based level sensors detect the weight shift. To turn, the user presses the handlebar to the left or the right.Robsteps are driven by electric motors and can reach a speed of 9.3 miles per hour (15 km/h). Robsteps are comparable to Segways. They are known as human transporters and personal mobility devices. Some customers use them as a disability device. There are now two different types of batteries fitted on these devices.

Depending on the organs to be examined, barium radiographs can be classified into ""barium swallow"", ""barium meal"", ""barium follow-through"", and ""enteroclysis"" (""small bowel enema""). To further enhance the quality of images, air or gas is sometimes introduced into the gastrointestinal tract in addition to barium, and this procedure is called double-contrast imaging.

Both agents are administered by lumbar puncture (also referred to as a spinal tap or cisternal puncture), at the cervicocranial junction. The human patient is rolled from the lateral decubitus (lying on the side) to prone. Ankles are strapped to the end of a hard X-ray, CT, or MRI table. To obtain images of the cervical region the patient is then carefully tilted in the Trendelenberg position (head down) so the contrast agent (particularly iofendylate) can enter the neck region. Care is given to prevent spilling dye into the posterior cranial fossa (back of the head) or to enter the cranial cavity in general. This speaks to the inability to remove the heavier or more viscous iofendylate without aspirating it with spinal fluid through a lumbar puncture needle in the low back (sticking up vertically) or back of the neck. Removal of iofendylate is necessary since it is not water-soluble.

Geminus started work in England by working with Thomas Raynalde and producing ""The byrth of Mankinde"" aka ""The Woman's booke"" in 1545. ""The byrth of Mankinde"", was the best English language reference work on midwifery in the 1500s. Its text was translated from Eucharius Rösslin's ""Der schwangern Frauwen und Hebammen Rosengarten"". Its first English edition was a 1540 translation by Richard Jonas. The second, by Thomas Raynalde, appeared in 1545 and saw many editions in the next 100 years. It discussed fertility, pregnancy, birth, and infant care, with the best anatomical descriptions then available. Its illustrations were again after Vesalius via Geminus’s ""Compendiosa"". The ""Compendiosa totius anatomie"" consisted of 41 unnumbered engraved sheets and was dedicated to Edward VI. One of the sheets was a fold-out engraving of the external anatomy of Adam and Eve; in addition there were 3 engravings of the skeleton, 16 of the muscles, 5 of the arteries and veins, 4 of the nerves, 6 of the organs, 4 of the brain, and one of the eye and its parts, all after woodcuts by Vesalius. The Latin edition of 1545 had been distributed in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and other countries. Geminus wrote in the later English version that it had been produced for the benefit of ""unlatined Surgeons"". He had employed Nicholas Udall, the playwright, to translate some of the work, while the text was taken from an early translation of Henri de Mondeville's ""Surgery"". The book was a great success, printing three editions in England - one in Latin (1545) and two in English translation (1553 and 1559). In his engraved copies, Geminus removed all the detail he regarded as superfluous, notably the background landscapes which had informed Vesalius's images. The copperplate engravings were the first ever to be done in England, and enjoyed a large following in France. Jacques Grévin, the French poet who also happened to be a physician and writer on matters medical, had print editions done from Geminus's plates in 1564, 1565 and a French translation in 1569. Watermarks suggest that the plates for the 1564 Paris edition were printed in London and then transported to Paris.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_illustrators,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artist109812338 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CausalAgent100007347 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Creator109614315 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Illustrator109812068 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingThing100004258 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Organism100004475 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Person100007846 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalIllustrators | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatPseudonymousArtists | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActor | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

CNF is a material composed of nanosized cellulose fibrils with a high aspect ratio (length to width ratio). Typical fibril widths are 5–20 nanometers with a wide range of lengths, typically several micrometers. It is pseudo-plastic and exhibits thixotropy, the property of certain gels or fluids that are thick (viscous) under normal conditions, but become less viscous when shaken or agitated. When the shearing forces are removed the gel regains much of its original state. The fibrils are isolated from any cellulose containing source including wood-based fibers (pulp fibers) through high-pressure, high temperature and high velocity impact homogenization, grinding or microfluidization (see manufacture below). Nanocellulose can also be obtained from native fibers by an acid hydrolysis, giving rise to highly crystalline and rigid nanoparticles which are shorter (100s to 1000 nanometers) than the cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) obtained through homogenization, microfluiodization or grinding routes.

Interventional radiology is the performance of usually minimally invasive medical procedures with the guidance of imaging technologies such as those mentioned above. The modern practice of radiology involves several different healthcare professions working as a team. The radiologist is a medical doctor who has completed the appropriate post-graduate training and interprets medical images, communicates these findings to other physicians by means of a report or verbally, and uses imaging to perform minimally invasive medical procedures. The nurse is involved in the care of patients before and after imaging or procedures, including administration of medications, monitoring of vital signs and monitoring of sedated patients. The radiographer, also known as a ""radiologic technologist"" in some countries such as the United States and Canada, is a specially trained healthcare professional that uses sophisticated technology and positioning techniques to produce medical images for the radiologist to interpret. Depending on the individual's training and country of practice, the radiographer may specialize in one of the above-mentioned imaging modalities or have expanded roles in image reporting.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_imaging | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Food | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PersonFunction | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

It may also be used to administer medications or other medical therapy such as blood products or electrolytes to correct electrolyte imbalances.

The intravenous route of administration is commonly used for rehydration or to provide nutrition for those who cannot consume food or water by mouth. It may also be used to administer medications or other medical therapy such as blood products or electrolytes to correct electrolyte imbalances. Attempts at providing intravenous therapy have been recorded as early as the 1400s, but the practice did not become widespread until the 1900s after the development of techniques for safe, effective use. The intravenous route is the fastest way to deliver medications and fluid replacement throughout the body as they are introduced directly into the circulatory system and thus quickly distributed. For this reason, the intravenous route of administration is also used for the consumption of some recreational drugs. Many therapies are administered as a ""bolus"" or one-time dose, but they may also be administered as an extended infusion or drip. The act of administering a therapy intravenously, or placing an intravenous line (""IV line"") for later use, is a procedure which should only be performed by a skilled professional. The most basic intravenous access consists of a needle piercing the skin and entering a vein which is connected to a syringe or to external tubing. This is used to administer the desired therapy. In cases where a patient is likely to receive many such interventions in a short period (with consequent risk of trauma to the vein), normal practice is to insert a cannula which leaves one end in the vein and subsequent therapies can be administered easily through tubing at the other end. In some cases, multiple medications or therapies are administered through the same IV line. IV lines are classified as ""central lines"" if they end in a large vein close to the heart, or as ""peripheral lines"" if their output is to a small vein in the periphery, such as the arm. An IV line can be threaded through a peripheral vein to end near the heart, which is termed a ""peripherally inserted central catheter"" or PICC line. If a person is likely to need long-term intravenous therapy, a medical port may be implanted to enable easier repeated access to the vein without having to pierce the vein repeatedly. A catheter can also be inserted into a central vein through the chest, which is known as a tunneled line. The specific type of catheter used and site of insertion are affected by the desired substance to be administered and the health of the veins in the desired site of insertion. Placement of an IV line may cause pain, as it necessarily involves piercing the skin. Infections and inflammation (termed phlebitis) are also both common side effects of an IV line. Phlebitis may be more likely if the same vein is used repeatedly for intravenous access, and can eventually develop into a hard cord which is unsuitable for IV access. The unintentional administration of a therapy outside a vein, termed extravasation or infiltration, may cause other side effects.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Intravenous_fluids,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Care100654885 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Fluid114939900 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Form106290637 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LanguageUnit106284225 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Treatment100658082 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDosageForms | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatIntravenousFluids | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTreatments | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Word106286395 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Work100575741 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Beverage | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Penetration by a sharp explorer can actually cause cavitation in areas that are remineralizing or could be remineralized. Dental lesions initially develop as a subsurface lesion. Early lesions may be reversed - with meticulous patient self-care and application of fluoride - as long as the thin surface layer remains intact. The use of a dental explorer with firm pressure to probe suspicious areas may result in the rupture of the surface layer covering early lesions. Instead, they argue that fluoride and oral hygiene should be used to remineralize the enamel and prevent it from decaying further. This debate still continues because sometimes decay can be difficult to diagnose without tactile verification.

The temperomandibular joints are not a simple hinge but rotate and translate forward when the mouth is opened. The principal movements reproduced are: at rest (centric jaw relation), in protrusion (to bite), from side to side (lateral excursion) to chew, in retrusion, and any possible combination of these. Counter-intuitively, it is the cast of the maxilla which moves relative to the cast of the mandible and the articulator. An articulator assists in the accurate fabrication of the biting surfaces of removable prosthodontic appliances (dentures), fixed prosthodontic restorations (implants, crowns, bridges, inlays and onlays) and orthodontic appliances. Used with skill it ensures correct interdigitation of the teeth and an anatomically functional biting plane. This means less occlusal adjustments before and after fitting dental appliances and fewer chronic conflicts between the teeth and the jaw joints. Articulators are used mainly by dental technicians in fabrication of prostheses and information regarding bite can be communicated from the prescribing dentist via a facebow alone. However it is advantageous when a system is utilised jointly in which case the clinician should adopt the articulator system currently in use in the dental laboratory as they are not compatible with each other.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Dental_equipment,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Device

It is a full-torso brace that extends from the pelvis to the base of the skull. It was originally designed by Blount and Schmidt in 1946 for postoperative care when surgery required long periods of immobilization. Milwaukee braces are often custom-made over a mold of the patient's torso, but in some cases, it can be made from prefabricated parts. Three bars—two posterior and one anterior—are attached to a pelvic girdle made of leather or plastic, as well as a neck ring. The ring has an anterior throat mold and two posterior occipital pads, which fit behind the patient's head. Lateral pads are strapped to the bars; adjustment of these straps holds the spine in alignment. This brace is normally used with growing adolescents to hold a 25° to 40° advancing curve although has been also been used successfully in adults to prevent further collapse or deformity of the spine. The brace is intended to minimize the progression of deformity to an acceptable level, not to completely correct the curvature. If, despite the brace, curve progression beyond 40-50 degrees is evident, surgery may be required. The Milwaukee brace is often prescribed to be worn 23 hours a day until the patient reaches skeletal maturity and growth ceases. Adults with a collapsing and / or developing spinal deformity are advised to wear the brace for a minimum of 20 hours per day. A related brace is the Boston brace (underarm brace, also known as a thoraco-lumbo-sacral orthosis, or TLSO), which is more commonly used for scoliosis. That brace does not have a neck ring and is more easily concealed under clothing, thus more acceptable to patients.

In the case of cigarette smoking these substances are contained in a mixture of aerosol particles and gases and include the pharmacologically active alkaloid nicotine; the vaporization creates heated aerosol and gas into a form that allows inhalation and deep penetration into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream of the active substances occurs. In some cultures, smoking is also carried out as a part of various rituals, where participants use it to help induce trance-like states that, they believe, can lead them to spiritual enlightenment. Smoking is one of the most common forms of recreational drug use. Tobacco smoking is the most popular form, being practised by over one billion people globally, of whom the majority are in the developing countries. Less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium. Some of the substances are classified as hard narcotics, like heroin, but the use of these is very limited as they are usually not commercially available. Cigarettes are primarily industrially manufactured but also can be hand-rolled from loose tobacco and rolling paper. Other smoking implements include pipes, cigars, bidis, hookahs, and bongs. Smoking can be dated to as early as 5000 BCE, and has been recorded in many different cultures across the world. Early smoking evolved in association with religious ceremonies; as offerings to deities, in cleansing rituals or to allow shamans and priests to alter their minds for purposes of divination or spiritual enlightenment. After the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, the practice of smoking tobacco quickly spread to the rest of the world. In regions like India and Sub-Saharan Africa, it merged with existing practices of smoking (mostly of cannabis). In Europe, it introduced a new type of social activity and a form of drug intake which previously had been unknown. Perception surrounding smoking has varied over time and from one place to another: holy and sinful, sophisticated and vulgar, a panacea and deadly health hazard. In the last decade of the 20th century, smoking came to be viewed in a decidedly negative light, especially in Western countries. Smoking generally has negative health effects, because smoke inhalation inherently poses challenges to various physiologic processes such as respiration. Smoking tobacco is among the leading causes of many diseases such as lung cancer, heart attack, COPD, erectile dysfunction, and birth defects. Diseases related to tobacco smoking have been shown to kill approximately half of long-term smokers when compared to average mortality rates faced by non-smokers. Smoking caused over five million deaths a year from 1990 to 2015. The health hazards of smoking have caused many countries to institute high taxes on tobacco products, publish advertisements to discourage use, limit advertisements that promote use, and provide help with quitting for those who do smoke.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Company | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Over the course of the pandemic, various states, counties, and municipalities have issued health orders requiring the wearing of non-medical face coverings — such as cloth masks — in spaces and/or businesses accessible to the public, especially when physical distancing is not possible. Some areas only mandated their use by public-facing employees of businesses at first, before extending them to the general public. Federal officials initially discouraged the general public from wearing masks for protecting themselves from COVID-19. In early April, federal officials reversed their guidance, saying that the general public should wear masks to lessen transmission by themselves, particularly from asymptomatic carriers. Public health experts such as Larry Gostin stated that federal officials should have recommended mask-wearing sooner; others noted that US government guidance lagged significantly behind mask recommendations in East Asian countries and likely exacerbated the scale of the pandemic in the United States. In September 2020, it was reported that the government had contemplated leveraging the United States Postal Service to distribute free reusable masks nationwide as early as April, but that it had scrapped the plan due to concerns it could ""create concern or panic"". Mask mandates were divisive. Republican-led states were, initially, less likely to impose health orders requiring the wearing of masks than Democratic-led states. Several states, including Arizona, Georgia, and Texas, took actions to block localized health orders requiring masks, but later softened their stances to help control local spikes. Some Americans felt mask mandates to be an infringement of their personal liberties, According to a Pew Research survey conducted in fall 2020, 19% of Republican respondents listed masks as a pandemic-related hardship, 27% of whom were skeptical about masks or the severity of the pandemic, compared with 10% of Democrats, 31% of whom expressed anxieties about the politicization of safety regulations and others who were not taking the pandemic seriously. Former president Donald Trump largely resisted wearing masks in public media appearances, and did not mandate their use at his rallies and other public campaign events for the 2020 presidential election. After briefly encouraging their use in mid-July, Trump continued to hold campaign events (such as the 2020 Republican National Convention) where masks were not widely used. Trump mocked and ridiculed Joe Biden, his Democratic opponent (and the eventual winner) in the election, for wearing face masks in public appearances. Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, and others criticized Trump's refusal, calling it dangerous and irresponsible. A lack of precautions (such as masks) taken during crowded White House ceremonies and receptions by Trump on September 26 were credited with having possibly resulted in a COVID-19 outbreak at the White House, which included Trump himself. After Biden was sworn in as president in January 2021, one of his first executive orders mandated stronger enforcement of COVID-19-related health and safety protocols, including masks, on federal properties. Biden also issued an executive order mandating the wearing of masks on public transport systems. In April 2021, as the country's vaccination program increased in pace, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidance stating that those who are fully vaccinated did not need to wear masks when in small outdoor gatherings. In May 2021, the CDC went further and issued guidance stating that fully vaccinated people did not need to wear masks nor physically distance in public, unless otherwise mandated by local laws or entities. The announcement faced a mixed reception, with critics arguing that this guidance largely relied on an honor system, and may have been premature given the country's progress on vaccination. The CDC recommends that masks be worn by unvaccinated people whenever they are with people who are outside of their immediate household.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_masks,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

One important tool used in many of these procedures is a catheter used to deliver many of things a surgeon needs to do his work, to impact target tissue and deliver a variety of medicines or disinfecting agents to treat disease or infection. Manufactured by Hansen Medical, Sensei X is a specialized robotic catheter system that is controlled by a physician and is designed for accurate positioning, manipulation and stable control of catheter and catheter-based technologies during cardiovascular procedures. The Sensei system obtained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance in 2007, after which the Cleveland Clinic's electrophysiology program, then directed by Dr. Andrea Natale, received the first placement. The Sensei Robotic Catheter System and Artisan Extend Control Catheter allow physicians to navigate flexible catheters with greater stability and control during complex cardiac arrhythmia procedures. Hansen Medical has related co-development agreements with the following industry leaders: St. Jude Medical, GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthcare, and Philips Medical Systems. Hansen Medical was founded by Dr. Frederic Moll, who had also co-founded Intuitive Surgical, manufacturer of the Da Vinci Surgical System, whose use has propelled medicinal robotics to the forefront of patient care. The Sensei system is indicated for use during the cardiac mapping phase of cardiac arrhythmia treatment in the US. Meanwhile, it has CE mark approval for facilitating the navigation of ablation catheters within the atria of the heart during complex arrhythmia procedures such as Atrial Fibrillation (AF). In November 2010, Hansen Medical received unconditional Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval from the FDA initiating a clinical trial to investigate the use of the Sensei X Robotic Catheter System and the Artisan Control Catheter for treatment of AF, the most common cardiac arrhythmia. The Principal Investigator of the ARTISAN AF Trial is Dr. Andrea Natale, executive medical director for Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute (TCAI). The first case in the trial was completed by Dr. Joseph Gallinghouse, an electrophysiologist, at the TCAI at St. David's Medical Center. By the end of 2010, nearly 100 Sensei systems have been shipped worldwide since its 2007 release. The system has been used to perform almost 5,000 procedures. The Sensei system operates by guiding standard catheters through a manipulated robotically steerable sheath (hollow tube) in the patient's vasculature. The doctor performs the procedure at a control station with a technology called ""IntelliSense"" to proximally measure the forces applied along the shaft of the catheter as a result of catheter tissue contact. The Artisan catheter has two robotically controlled segments which provides six degrees of freedom and 270 degrees of bend articulation which can assist physicians in accessing hard-to-reach cardiac anatomy. The open lumen Artisan catheter accommodates 8F percutaneous EP catheters.

Guidelines for training have been formulated, and only qualified individuals should perform this highly specialized examination. A brief description of the examination is presented here for interest only. The first step is to determine the position and orientation of the fetus within the uterus. Within the thorax, the heart, because of its motion, is usually the easiest and most recognizable structure to examine. The four-chamber view is most important and should be recorded first. For orientation, the left atrium is identified by the presence of the septum primum and the pulmonary veins. can be determined by identifying the systemic veins and the position of the atria relative to the liver and spleen. Next, the atrioventricular valves are identified, with the tricuspid valve slightly more apical than the mitral valve. The outlet portions of the heart are then evaluated. Cardiac measurements can be made and compared with normal values that have been defined for all gestational ages. Doppler techniques can be used to visualize blood flow through the heart, great vessels, and umbilical vessels. Assessment of fetal arrhythmias is best accomplished by using a combination of M-mode and Doppler recordings. When these arrhythmias are present, a careful search for structural heart disease is mandatory. With this approach, a wealth of diagnostic information is available. Knowledge of complex congenital heart disease before delivery allows therapeutic interventions to begin immediately after birth and can be life saving for such patients. In both of these examples, knowledge about the presence and severity of congenital cardiac defects facilitated management of labor and delivery and allowed perinatal care to be optimized. The critical role of echocardiography in prenatal diagnosis is evident, and both the accuracy and safety of the test are now well established. The structures in these images are small, however, and random movements of the fetus make for a challenging and time-consuming examination. Despite these factors, fetal echocardiography has provided clinicians with earlier diagnosis of heart disease and a better understanding of fetal hemodynamics. Today, a dedicated fetal echocardiogram can detect nearly 100% of serious congenital heart disease. Yet most pregnant women do not have a fetal echocardiogram but rather undergo a general obstetric ultrasound that may detect only around a third of fetal heart disease. To improve detection, some propose universal fetal echocardiography. But others cite cost and lack of specialized personnel as barriers that prevent echocardiography for every fetus. Fetal Echocardiogram is done in select patients. The best way to improve pickup in majority if the patients is by training sonologists to perform a more thorough evaluation. It has been traditionally taught that a four chamber visualisation is enough but current experiences suggest that may not be enough. A better evaluation would include a 4 chamber, a 5 chamber and a 3 vessel evaluation(3).",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cardiac_imaging | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_ultrasonography,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Cricketer

The MR signal in MRI is produced by the process of resonance, which is the result of radiofrequency coils. They consist of two electromagnetic coils, the transmitter and receiver, which generate the field and receive the resulting signal. Atomic nuclei of interest in MRI studies have their own resonant frequencies, in the radiofrequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Although the electromagnetic fields produced by the transmitting coil are in the RF range of tens of megahertz (often in the shortwave radio portion of the electromagnetic spectrum) at powers usually exceeding the highest powers used by amateur radio, there is very little RF interference produced by the MRI machine. The reason for this is that the MRI is a very poor radio transmitter, and is without an antenna. The RF frequency electromagnetic field produced in the ""transmitting coil"" is a magnetic near-field with very little associated changing electric field component (such as all conventional radio wave transmissions have). Thus, the high-powered electromagnetic field produced in the MRI transmitter coil does not produce much electromagnetic radiation at its RF frequency, and the RF power is confined to the coil space and not radiated as ""radio waves."" Thus, the transmitting coil is a good EM near-field generator at radio frequency, but a poor EM radiation transmitter at radio frequency. The receiver coil picks up the oscillations at RF frequencies produced by precession of the magnetic moment of nuclei inside the subject. The signal acquired by the coil is thus an induced emf, and is not the result of picking up radio waves. This is a common misconception, and unfortunately, has propagated through the literature.

It allows the application of ultrasound technology, such as piezoelectric transducer or CMUT, to see from inside blood vessels out through the surrounding blood column, visualizing the endothelium (inner wall) of blood vessels. The arteries of the heart (the coronary arteries) are the most frequent imaging target for IVUS. IVUS is used in the coronary arteries to determine the amount of atheromatous plaque built up at any particular point in the epicardial coronary artery. Intravascular ultrasound provides a unique method to study the regression or progression of atherosclerotic lesions in vivo. The progressive accumulation of plaque within the artery wall over decades is the setup for vulnerable plaque which, in turn, leads to heart attack and stenosis (narrowing) of the artery (known as coronary artery lesions). IVUS is of use to determine both plaque volume within the wall of the artery and/or the degree of stenosis of the artery lumen. It can be especially useful in situations in which angiographic imaging is considered unreliable; such as for the lumen of ostial lesions or where angiographic images do not visualize lumen segments adequately, such as regions with multiple overlapping arterial segments. It is also used to assess the effects of treatments of stenosis such as with hydraulic angioplasty expansion of the artery, with or without stents, and the results of medical therapy over time.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_ultrasonography,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatVascularProcedures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Software

Rubin estimated that it was used to administer 200 million vaccinations per year during the final years of the campaign. After the September 11, 2001 attacks and subsequent anthrax scares, the US government ordered the smallpox vaccine be available for every person in the country. Precision Medical Products, Inc. was awarded the contract to make the bifurcated needles to go along with the vaccine and made over 400,000,000 of these needles in a two year span.

Modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) make use of this effect. The NMR signal observed following an initial excitation pulse decays with time due to both spin relaxation and any inhomogeneous effects which cause different spins in the sample to precess at different rates. The first of these, relaxation, leads to an irreversible loss of magnetisation. However, the inhomogeneous dephasing can be removed by applying a 180° inversion pulse that inverts the magnetisation vectors. Examples of inhomogeneous effects include a magnetic field gradient and a distribution of chemical shifts. If the inversion pulse is applied after a period t of dephasing, the inhomogeneous evolution will rephase to form an echo at time 2t. In simple cases, the intensity of the echo relative to the initial signal is given by e–2t/T2 where T2 is the time constant for spin-spin relaxation. The echo time (TE) is the time between the excitation pulse and the peak of the signal. Echo phenomena are important features of coherent spectroscopy which have been used in fields other than magnetic resonance including laser spectroscopy and neutron scattering. Echoes were first detected in nuclear magnetic resonance by Erwin Hahn in 1950, and spin echoes are sometimes referred to as Hahn echoes. In nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging, radiofrequency radiation is most commonly used. In 1972 introduced spin echo neutron scattering, a technique that can be used to study magnons and phonons in single crystals. The technique is now applied in research facilities using triple axis spectrometers. In 2020 two teams demonstrated that when strongly coupling an ensemble of spins to a resonator, the Hahn pulse sequence does not just lead to a single echo, but rather to a whole train of periodic echoes. In this process the first Hahn echo acts back on the spins as a refocusing pulse, leading to self-stimulated secondary echoes.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Magnetic_resonance_imaging,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Ability105616246 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Know-how105616786 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Method105660268 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Technique105665146 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatScientificTechniques

The system has been tested on over 70 adults (data presented at clinical meetings). SLP is simple to use, accurate and cost effective, is self-calibrating and does not require the use of plastic consumables, reducing cost, risk of cross infection and the device's carbon footprint. In conjunction with the Cambridge Veterinary School, proof of concept studies have indicated that the device is sensitive enough to noninvasively pick up respiratory movements in domestic animals (cats and dogs). A totally “non-invasive” technique using structured light to measure pulmonary function was developed as long ago as the mid-1980s by a London group at the Royal Brompton Hospital working in close association with IBM (1-4). The technique used the distortion with movement of a structured pattern of light to calculate a volume or change in volume of a textured surface. At that time structured light pattern was shone on to the anterior chest and abdominal wall surfaces, and movie camera film footage was taken and sent to IBM for processing. The digital information was used to compute automatically the volume of the trunk and the position of any point on its surface and its cross-sectional shape at any level. The group found that linear dimensions could be calculated to within 0.5mm and a cross-sectional area within 5% and volume within 3-7%. The group suggested that non-invasive technique measurements were of sufficient accuracy to be tried in clinical practice. However, probably due to technology limitations, data processing and storage, the methodology was never commercialised. Independently the Royal Brompton group of the 1980s, a Cambridge (UK) consortium of clinicians and engineers developed a system in 2009 that has revisited structure light pattern as a noninvasive method for collecting accurate representations of chest and abdominal wall movement. The methodology has several advantages: there are no fluorescent markers required to define chest or abdominal surface and the hardware can be minimalized to 2 digital cameras and a digital projector when imaging the anterior surface of the body. The projector shines a grid of black and white squares from superior iliac crest to clavicle; the subject can wear a plain t-shirt of any colour. The 2 digital cameras image the grid on chest and abdomen and the software extracts 2 sets of 2D image positions of the grid points and stereo vision is used to reconstruct these grid points to form a 3D representation of the chest and abdominal wall surface. The group has tried anything from one grid point to 2000 and is current working on roughly 200 to 300. The thoracic volume is calculated from the volume beneath the reconstructed virtual surface and can be plotted in real time. Calibration is internal: the relative position of cameras and shape of the subject is auto-calibrated at reconstruction time; and externally by placing an object of reference size in front of the cameras. This can be a sheet of paper of known size and potentially has now been transferred to projected points within the grid itself. The group have now collected data on up to 70 adults and 5 children and have also collected data from small mammals. They have compared simultaneous measurements of tidal breathing followed by full inspiration and force expiration by Pneumatac and SLP. The Pneumatac data was obtained using a laptop based spirometer and exported for analysis using J-scope software. Extremely good correlations have been obtained from tidal breaching and forced expiration manoeuvres. Tidal breathing correlations have shown to be 0.99 for individual data sets and for n=70 the mean correlation was 0.92 at an SD of 0.04. For forced expiration the correlation was shown to be 0.98, n=70 mean correlation was 0.98 with an SD of 0.12. For forced expirations inspiratory manoeuvres correlation coefficients for peak flow were r² 0.84, FEV1 0.95, FEF75 0.76 and FEF50 0.69.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Respiratory_system_imaging,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Experiment105798043 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/HigherCognitiveProcess105770664 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Inquiry105797597 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ProblemSolving105796750 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Process105701363 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thinking105770926 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Trial105799212 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTests

Shape memory is the ability of nitinol to undergo deformation at one temperature, stay in its deformed shape when the external force is removed, then recover its original, undeformed shape upon heating above its ""transformation temperature"". Superelasticity is the ability for the metal to undergo large deformations and immediately return to its undeformed shape upon removal of the external load. Nitinol can deform 10–30 times as much as ordinary metals and return to its original shape. Whether nitinol behaves with the shape memory effect or superelasticity depends on whether it is above the transformation temperature of the specific alloy.

Today, laudanum is recognized as addictive and is strictly regulated and controlled as such throughout most of the world. The United States Uniform Controlled Substances Act, for one example, lists it on Schedule II. Laudanum is known as a ""whole opium"" preparation since it historically contained all the opium alkaloids. Today, however, the drug is often processed to remove all or most of the noscapine (also called narcotine) present as this is a strong emetic and does not add appreciably to the analgesic or antipropulsive properties of opium; the resulting solution is called Denarcotized Tincture of Opium or Deodorized Tincture of Opium (DTO). Laudanum remains available by prescription in the United States and theoretically in the United Kingdom, although today the drug's therapeutic indications are generally confined to controlling diarrhea, alleviating pain, and easing withdrawal symptoms in infants born to mothers addicted to heroin or other opioids. Recent enforcement action by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) against manufacturers of paregoric and opium tincture suggests that opium tincture's availability in the U.S. may be in jeopardy. The terms laudanum and tincture of opium are generally interchangeable, but in contemporary medical practice, the latter is used almost exclusively.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Tinctures,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ChemicalSubstance | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/CombinationDrug | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Disease | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Drug | http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#ChemicalObject | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8386

The goal of mammography is the early detection of breast cancer, typically through detection of characteristic masses or microcalcifications. As with all X-rays, mammograms use doses of ionizing radiation to create images. These images are then analyzed for abnormal findings. It is usual to employ lower-energy X-rays, typically Mo (K-shell x-ray energies of 17.5 and 19.6 keV) and Rh (20.2 and 22.7 keV) than those used for radiography of bones. Ultrasound, ductography, positron emission mammography (PEM), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are adjuncts to mammography. Ultrasound is typically used for further evaluation of masses found on mammography or palpable masses not seen on mammograms. Ductograms are still used in some institutions for evaluation of bloody nipple discharge when the mammogram is non-diagnostic. MRI can be useful for further evaluation of questionable findings, as well as for screening pre-surgical evaluation in patients with known breast cancer, in order to detect additional lesions that might change the surgical approach, for example, from breast-conserving lumpectomy to mastectomy. Other procedures being investigated include tomosynthesis. For the average woman, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends (2016) mammography every two years between the ages of 50 and 74, concluding that ""the benefit of screening mammography outweighs the harms by at least a moderate amount from age 50 to 74 years and is greatest for women in their 60s"". The American College of Radiology and American Cancer Society recommend yearly screening mammography starting at age 40. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (2012) and the European Cancer Observatory (2011) recommend mammography every 2 to 3 years between ages 50 and 69. These task force reports point out that in addition to unnecessary surgery and anxiety, the risks of more frequent mammograms include a small but significant increase in breast cancer induced by radiation. Additionally, mammograms should not be performed with increased frequency in patients undergoing breast surgery, including breast enlargement, mastopexy, and breast reduction. The Cochrane Collaboration (2013) concluded after ten years that trials with adequate randomization did not find an effect of mammography screening on total cancer mortality, including breast cancer. The authors of this Cochrane review write: ""If we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% and that overdiagnosis and over-treatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2,000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings."" The authors conclude that the time has come to re-assess whether universal mammography screening should be recommended for any age group. They state that universal screening may not be reasonable. The Nordic Cochrane Collection updated research in 2012 and stated that advances in diagnosis and treatment make mammography screening less effective today, rendering it “no longer effective.” They conclude that “it therefore no longer seems reasonable to attend” for breast cancer screening at any age, and warn of misleading information on the internet. On the contrary, a report in the New England Journal of Medicine attributes the poor effectiveness of national mammography screening programs at reducing breast cancer mortality to radiation-induced cancers. Mammography has a false-negative (missed cancer) rate of at least ten percent. This is partly due to dense tissue obscuring the cancer and the appearance of cancer on mammograms having a large overlap with the appearance of normal tissue. A meta-analysis review of programs in countries with organized screening found a 52% over-diagnosis rate.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Breast_imaging,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Election | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Graduating from phantoms based on simple quadratic equations to voxelized phantoms, which were based on actual medical images of the human body, was a major step. The newest models are based on more advanced mathematics, such as non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) and polygon meshes, which allow for 4-D phantoms where simulations can take place not only 3-dimensional space but in time as well. Phantoms have been developed for a wide variety of humans, from children to adolescents to adults, male and female, as well as pregnant women. With such a variety of phantoms, many kinds of simulations can be run, from dose received from medical imaging procedures to nuclear medicine.

The Hemopump Cardiac Assist System is an older design intra-arterial, axial-flow pump circulatory assist device concept that offers temporary left ventricular support to patients in refractory cardiogenic shock without requiring major surgery for insertion. The Hemopump draws blood with the impeller from the left ventricle and then exchanges it through the aorta. It can run at a constant speed, or two variable speeds during the cardiac cycle. Volume of the stroke, the rotating speed, or the pressure can all be tuned. These different setting are used for different conditions of the heart. It is optimal to run at two different speeds through a cardiac cycle as opposed to a constant speed. Running the pump at maximum capacity can be dangerous as it has led to complete collapse of the left ventricle in animal trials. When in use there was low risk involved with the use of the Hemopump. There were not been many complications in patients that had used the pump. Any complications resulting in morbidity were seen to be rare.

It is composed of poliglecaprone 25, which is a copolymer of glycolide and epsilon-caprolactone. It comes both dyed (violet) and undyed (clear) and is an absorbable monofilament suture. It is generally used for soft-tissue approximation and ligation. It is used frequently for subcuticular dermis closures of the face. It has less of a tendency to exit through the skin after it breaks down, such as Vicryl. It is contraindicated for use in cardiovascular and neurologic tissues and for usage in ophthalmic and microsurgery. The use of Poliglecaprone suture may be inappropriate in elderly, malnourished, or debilitated patients or in patients suffering from conditions that may delay wound healing. Monocryl has a low tissue reactivity, maintains high tensile strength, and has a half-life of 7 to 14 days. At 1 week, its in vivo tensile strength is at 50–60% undyed (60–70% dyed), 20–30% undyed (30–40% dyed) at two weeks, and essentially completely hydrolyzed by 91–119 days. When removed from the package, it has a high degree of ""memory"", or coil. It is slippery, making it easier to pass than a braided suture. It has a consistency close to nylon suture material.

The ICD is the first-line treatment and prophylactic therapy for patients at risk for sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Current devices can be programmed to detect abnormal heart rhythms and deliver therapy via programmable antitachycardia pacing in addition to low-energy and high-energy shocks. ""AICD"" was trademarked by the Boston Scientific corporation, so the more generic ""ICD"" is preferred terminology. Current device batteries last about six to ten years; with advances in technology (batteries with more capacity or potentially rechargeable batteries) it may be possible to increase this well past ten years. The lead (the electrical cable connecting the device to the heart) has a much longer average longevity but can incur various types of malfunction, specifically insulation failure or fracture of the conductor, and require replacement. The process of implantation of an ICD system is similar to implantation of a pacemaker. In fact, ICDs are composed of an ICD generator and of wires. The first component or generator contains a computer chip or circuitry with RAM (memory), programmable software, a capacitor and a battery; this is implanted typically under the skin in the left upper chest. The second part of the system is an electrode wire or wires that, similar to pacemakers, are connected to the generator and passed through a vein to the right chambers of the heart. The lead usually lodges in the apex or septum of the right ventricle. Just like pacemakers, ICDs can have a single wire or lead in the heart (in the right ventricle, single chamber ICD), two leads (in the right atrium and right ventricle, dual chamber ICD) or three leads (biventricular ICD, one in the right atrium, one in the right ventricle and one on the outer wall of the left ventricle). The difference between pacemakers and ICDs is that pacemakers are also available as temporary units and are generally designed to correct slow heart rates, i.e. bradycardia, while ICDs are often permanent safeguards against sudden life-threatening arrhythmias. Recent developments include the subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD), and the ability to pace the left ventricle from multiple sites near-simultaneously with Multipoint Pacing (Abbott).",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cardiac_electrophysiology | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine) | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_devices | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroprosthetics,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Care100654885 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Crisis107417644 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Emergency107417405 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Happening107283608 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Juncture107416714 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Treatment100658082 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCardiacProcedures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalEmergencies | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTreatments | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Work100575741 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Device

These channels are slightly permeable to sodium ions, so they are also called Ca2+-Na+ channels, but their permeability to calcium is about 1000-fold greater than to sodium under normal physiological conditions. At physiologic or resting membrane potential, VGCCs are normally closed. They are activated (i.e.: opened) at depolarized membrane potentials and this is the source of the ""voltage-gated"" epithet. The concentration of calcium (Ca2+ ions) is normally several thousand times higher outside the cell than inside. Activation of particular VGCCs allows a Ca2+ influx into the cell, which, depending on the cell type, results in activation of calcium-sensitive potassium channels, muscular contraction, excitation of neurons, up-regulation of gene expression, or release of hormones or neurotransmitters. VGCCs have been immunolocalized in the zona glomerulosa of normal and hyperplastic human adrenal, as well as in aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA), and in the latter T-type VGCCs correlated with plasma aldosterone levels of patients. Excessive activation of VGCCs is a major component of excitotoxicity, as severely elevated levels of intracellular calcium activates enzymes which, at high enough levels, can degrade essential cellular structures.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Biomolecule | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Protein | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q206229 | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8054

This absorption of light is made possible by photosensitizers' large de-localized π-systems, which lowers the energy of HOMO and LUMO orbitals to promote photoexcitation.

Even smaller cell organelles such as mitochondria are typically 1-2 µm. Therefore, a proper model should account for the size of the specimen being studied. In addition, the size of vesicles dictates their membrane curvature which is an important factor in studying fusion proteins. SUVs have a higher membrane curvature and vesicles with high membrane curvature can promote membrane fusion faster than vesicles with lower membrane curvature such as GUVs. The composition and characteristics of the cell membrane varies in different cells (plant cells, mammalian cells, bacterial cells, etc). In a membrane bilayer, often the composition of the phospholipids is different between the inner and outer leaflets. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and sphingomyelin are some of the most common lipids most animal cell membranes. These lipids are widely different in charge, length, and saturation state. The presence of unsaturated bonds (double bonds) in lipids for example, creates a kink in acyl chains which further changes the lipid packing and results in a looser packing. Therefore, the composition and sizes of the unilamellar liposomes must be chosen carefully based on the subject of the study. Each lipid bilayer structure is comparable to lamellar phase lipid organization in biological membranes, in general. In contrast, multilamellar liposomes (MLVs), consist of many concentric amphiphilic lipid bilayers analogous to onion layers, and MLVs may be of variable sizes up to several micrometers.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

This change in conformation is a response to changes in transmembrane voltage. These voltage-dependent changes in function are critical for a large number of processes in excitable and nonexcitable cells.",literal,en,"In electrophysiology, the term gating refers to the opening (activation) or closing (by deactivation or inactivation) of ion channels. This change in conformation is a response to changes in transmembrane voltage. When ion channels are in a 'closed' (non-conducting) state, they are impermeable to ions and do not conduct electrical current. When ion channels are in their open state, they conduct electrical current by allowing specific types of ions to pass through them, and thus, across the plasma membrane of the cell. Gating is the process by which an ion channel transitions between its open and closed states. A variety of cellular changes can trigger gating, depending on the ion channel, including changes in voltage across the cell membrane (voltage-gated ion channels), chemicals interacting with the ion channel (ligand-gated ion channels), changes in temperature, stretching or deformation of the cell membrane, addition of a phosphate group to the ion channel (phosphorylation), and interaction with other molecules in the cell (e.g., G proteins). The rate at which any of these gating processes occurs in response to these triggers are known as the kinetics of gating. Some drugs and many ion channel toxins act as 'gating modifiers' of voltage-gated ion channels by changing the kinetics of gating. The voltage-gated ion channels of the action potential are often described as having four gating processes: activation, deactivation, inactivation, and reactivation (also called 'recovery from inactivation'). Activation is the process of opening the activation gate, which occurs in response to the voltage inside the cell membrane (the membrane potential) becoming more positive with respect to the outside of the cell (depolarization), and 'deactivation' is the opposite process of the activation gate closing in response to the inside of the membrane becoming more negative (repolarization).

It is hoped that EIM as a biomarker will result in the more rapid and efficient identification of new treatments for ALS. EIM has shown sensitivity to disease status in a variety of neuromuscular conditions, including radiculopathy, inflammatory myopathy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy. In addition to the assessment of neuromuscular disease, EIM also has the prospect of serving as a convenient and sensitive measure of muscle condition. Work in aging populations and individuals with orthopedic injuries indicates that EIM is very sensitive to muscle atrophy and disuse and is conversely likely sensitive to muscle conditioning and hypertrophy.

Nasal cannula and simple face masks are described as low flow delivery systems. Unlike the non-rebreather and partial rebreather masks, the simple face mask lacks a reservoir bag. It also has holes in the mask instead of the non-rebreather's one-way valves, so ambient air can enter the mask. This feature eliminates the danger of suffocation present if a mask with one-way valves becomes disconnected from oxygen. Therefore, the simple face mask is commonly preferred by basic life support personnel such as firefighters, lifeguards and other non-medical rescue personnel trained in basic first aid. The final oxygen concentration delivered by a simple face mask is dependent upon the amount of room air that mixes with the oxygen the patient breathes. The air mixing is determined by how much air any individual is breathing at the moment, combined with the fit of the mask. Because of the variability in these factors, the final oxygen concentration is somewhat uncontrolled. A venturi device attached to the mask can be used to control to some degree the concentration of oxygen delivered; usually this is used to prevent hypoxia in emphysema patients who have lost the ability to fully inhale. The effectiveness of the therapy can be continuously monitored using a pulse oximeter, though more clinically useful data can be obtained by drawing arterial blood gas.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_masks,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Weapon

An echocardiogram uses high frequency sound waves to create an image of the heart while the use of Doppler technology allows determination of the speed and direction of blood flow by utilizing the Doppler effect. An echocardiogram can, within certain limits, produce accurate assessment of the direction of blood flow and the velocity of blood and cardiac tissue at any arbitrary point using the Doppler effect. One of the limitations is that the ultrasound beam should be as parallel to the blood flow as possible. Velocity measurements allow assessment of cardiac valve areas and function, any abnormal communications between the left and right side of the heart, any leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), calculation of the cardiac output and calculation of E/A ratio (a measure of diastolic dysfunction). Contrast-enhanced ultrasound-using gas-filled microbubble contrast media can be used to improve velocity or other flow-related medical measurements. An advantage of Doppler echocardiography is that it can be used to measure blood flow within the heart without invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterization. In addition, with slightly different filter/gain settings, the method can measure tissue velocities by tissue Doppler echocardiography. The combination of flow and tissue velocities can be used for estimating left ventricular filling pressure, although only under certain conditions. Although ""Doppler"" has become synonymous with ""velocity measurement"" in medical imaging, in many cases it is not the frequency shift (Doppler shift) of the received signal that is measured, but the phase shift (when the received signal arrives).

An echocardiogram can also give physicians other estimates of heart function, such as a calculation of the cardiac output, ejection fraction, and diastolic function (how well the heart relaxes). Echocardiography is an important tool in assessing wall motion abnormality in patients with suspected cardiac disease. It is a tool which helps in reaching an early diagnosis of myocardial infarction showing regional wall motion abnormality of the heart. Also, it is important in treatment and followup in patients with heart failure, by assessing ejection fraction. Echocardiography can help detect cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and many others. The use of stress echocardiography may also help determine whether any chest pain or associated symptoms are related to heart disease. The biggest advantage of echocardiography is that it is not invasive (does not involve breaking the skin or entering body cavities) and has no known risks or side effects.Not only can an echocardiogram create ultrasound images of heart structures, but it can also produce accurate assessment of the blood flowing through the heart by Doppler echocardiography, using pulsed- or continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound. This allows assessment of both normal and abnormal blood flow through the heart. Color Doppler, as well as spectral Doppler, is used to visualize any abnormal communications between the left and right sides of the heart, any leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), and estimate how well the valves open (or do not open in the case of valvular stenosis). The Doppler technique can also be used for tissue motion and velocity measurement, by tissue Doppler echocardiography. Echocardiography was also the first ultrasound subspecialty to use intravenous contrast. Echocardiography is performed by cardiac sonographers, cardiac physiologists (UK), or physicians trained in echocardiography. Recognized as the ""Father of Echocardiography"", the Swedish physician Inge Edler (1911-2001), a graduate of Lund University, was the first of his profession to apply ultrasonic pulse echo imaging in diagnosing cardiac disease, which the acoustical physicist Floyd Firestone had developed to detect defects in metal castings. In fact, Edler in 1953 produced the first echocardiographs using an industrial Firestone-Sperry Ultrasonic Reflectoscope. In developing echocardiography, Edler worked with the physicist Carl Hellmuth Hertz, the son of the Nobel laureate Gustav Hertz and grandnephew of Heinrich Rudolph Hertz.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cardiac_imaging | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_ultrasonography | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiology,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

AHPs have been segregated into ""fast"", ""medium"", and ""slow"" components that appear to have distinct ionic mechanisms and durations. While fast and medium AHPs can be generated by single action potentials, slow AHPs generally develop only during trains of multiple action potentials. During single action potentials, transient depolarization of the membrane opens more voltage-gated K+ channels than are open in the resting state, many of which do not close immediately when the membrane returns to its normal resting voltage. This can lead to an ""undershoot"" of the membrane potential to values that are more polarized (""hyperpolarized"") than was the original resting membrane potential. Ca2+-activated K+ channels that open in response to the influx of Ca2+ during the action potential carry much of the K+ current as the membrane potential becomes more negative. The K+ permeability of the membrane is transiently unusually high, driving the membrane voltage VM even closer to the K+ equilibrium voltage EK. Hence, hyperpolarization persists until the membrane K+ permeability returns to its usual value. Medium and slow AHP currents also occur in neurons. The ionic mechanisms underlying medium and slow AHPs are not yet well understood, but may also involve M current and HCN channels for medium AHPs, and ion-dependent currents and/or ionic pumps for slow AHPs. The afterhyperpolarized (sAHP) state can be followed by an afterdepolarized state (which is not to be confused with the cardiac afterdepolarization) and can thus set the phase of the subthreshold oscillation of the membrane potential, as reported for the stellate cells of the entorhinal cortex.

DPIs are commonly used to treat respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, emphysema and COPD although DPIs (such as Inhalable insulin) have also been used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. DPIs are an alternative to the aerosol-based inhalers commonly called metered-dose inhaler (or MDI). The DPIs may require some procedure to allow a measured dose of powder to be ready for the patient to take. The medication is commonly held either in a capsule for manual loading or a proprietary from inside the inhaler. Once loaded or actuated, the operator puts the mouthpiece of the inhaler into their mouth and takes a sharp, deep inhalation (ensuring that the medication reaches the lower parts of the lungs), holding their breath for 5–10 seconds. There are a variety of such devices. The dose that can be delivered is typically less than a few tens of milligrams in a single breath since larger powder doses may lead to provocation of cough. Most DPIs rely on the force of patient inhalation to entrain powder from the device and subsequently break-up the powder into particles that are small enough to reach the lungs. For this reason, insufficient patient inhalation flow rates may lead to reduced dose delivery and incomplete deaggregation of the powder, leading to unsatisfactory device performance. Thus, most DPIs have a minimum inspiratory effort that is needed for proper use and it is for this reason that such DPIs are normally used only in older children and adults.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Care100654885 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Form106290637 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LanguageUnit106284225 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Treatment100658082 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDosageForms | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTreatments | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Word106286395 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Work100575741 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Device

* coagulation of blood thereby interrupting bloodflow to the tissue in turn causing ischemia and cell death; and 3. 
* induction of apoptosis, the so-called programmed cell death cascade. The most common application of cryoablation is to ablate solid tumors found in the lung, liver, breast, kidney and prostate. The use in prostate and renal cryoablation are the most common.

The DASB image from a human PET scan shows high binding in the midbrain, thalamus and striatum, moderate binding in the medial temporal lobe and anterior cingulate, and low binding in neocortex.The cerebellum is often regarded as a region with no specific serotonin transporter binding and the brain region is used as a reference in some studies. Since the serotonin transporter is the target of SSRIs used in the treatment of major depression it has been natural to examine DASB binding in depressed patients.Several such research studies have been performed. There are a number of alternative PET radioligands for imaging the serotonin transporter: [11C], [11C], [11C]AFM, [11C]DAPA, [11C]McN5652, and [11C]-NS 4194.A related molecule to DASB, that can be labeled with fluorine-18, has also been suggested as a PET radioligand. With single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using the radioisotope iodine-123 there are further radioligands available: [123I]ODAM, [123I]IDAM, [123I]ADAM, and [123I]β-CIT.A few studies have examined the difference in binding between the radioligands in nonhuman primates, as well as in pigs.

The stress response is induced by exercise or by intravenous pharmacological stimulation. Cardiac stress tests compare the coronary circulation while the patient is at rest with the same patient's circulation during maximum cardiac exertion, showing any abnormal blood flow to the myocardium (heart muscle tissue). The results can be interpreted as a reflection on the general physical condition of the test patient. This test can be used to diagnose coronary artery disease (also known as ischemic heart disease) and assess patient prognosis after a myocardial infarction (heart attack). Exercise-induced stressors are most commonly either exercise on a treadmill or pedalling a stationary exercise bicycle ergometer. The level of stress is progressively increased by raising the difficulty (steepness of the slope on a treadmill or resistance on an ergometer) and speed. People who cannot use their legs may exercise with a bicycle-like crank that they turn with their arms. Once the stress test is completed, the patient generally is advised to not suddenly stop activity but to slowly decrease the intensity of the exercise over the course of several minutes. The test administrator or attending physician examines the symptoms and blood pressure response. To measure the heart's response to the stress the patient may be connected to an electrocardiogram (ECG); in this case the test is most commonly called a cardiac stress test but is known by other names, such as exercise testing, stress testing treadmills, exercise tolerance test, stress test or stress test ECG. Alternatively a stress test may use an echocardiogram for ultrasonic imaging of the heart (in which case the test is called an echocardiography stress test or stress echo), or a gamma camera to image radioisotopes injected into the bloodstream (called a nuclear stress test).",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Nuclear_medicine,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Engagement101239064 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Experiment105798043 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/GroupAction101080366 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/HigherCognitiveProcess105770664 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Inquiry105797597 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intervention101240210 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ProblemSolving105796750 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Process105701363 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Thinking105770926 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Trial105799212 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCardiacProcedures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMedicalTests | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Cricketer

It was involved in at least six accidents between 1985 and 1987, in which patients were given massive overdoses of radiation. Because of concurrent programming errors (also known as race conditions), it sometimes gave its patients radiation doses that were hundreds of times greater than normal, resulting in death or serious injury. These accidents highlighted the dangers of software control of safety-critical systems, and they have become a standard case study in health informatics and software engineering. Additionally, the overconfidence of the engineers and lack of proper due diligence to resolve reported software bugs are highlighted as an extreme case where the engineers' overconfidence in their initial work and failure to believe the end users' claims caused drastic repercussions.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Nuclear_medicine,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Calamity107314838 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Failure100066636 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Happening107283608 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Misfortune107304852 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Nonaccomplishment100066216 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Trouble107289014 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatEngineeringFailures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatHealthDisasters | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatHealthDisastersInCanada | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Software

However, thorium is retained in the body, and it is radioactive, emitting harmful alpha radiation as it decays. Because the suspension offered high image quality and had virtually no immediate side-effects compared to the alternatives available at the time, Thorotrast became widely used after its introduction in 1931. António Egas Moniz contributed to its development. About 2 to 10 million patients worldwide have been treated with Thorotrast.

As optogenetics is used by some authors to refer to only optical control of the activity of genetically defined neurons and not these additional research approaches, the term optogenetics is an example of polysemy. Neuronal control is achieved using optogenetic actuators like channelrhodopsin, halorhodopsin, and archaerhodopsin, while optical recording of neuronal activities can be made with the help of optogenetic sensors for calcium (GCaMPs), vesicular release (synapto-pHluorin), neurotransmitters (GluSnFRs), or membrane voltage (Quasars, Accelerated Sensor of Action Potentials, Archons). Control (or recording) of activity is restricted to genetically defined neurons and performed in a spatiotemporal-specific manner by light. In 2010, optogenetics was chosen as the ""Method of the Year"" across all fields of science and engineering by the interdisciplinary research journal Nature Methods.

They have the particularity to fit firmly the ankle and correct concisely the foot deformity within special pressure points. It is stated to help in improving mobility and stability of the ankle joint on CP patients, evidence shows that immediate gross motor function improved with the use of DAFO’s as well. Designed to help a patient maintain a functional position, a DAFO can improve stability for successful standing and walking. Different from a traditional Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO), which is typically stiff and rigid, a DAFO is characteristically thin, flexible and wraps around the patient’s entire foot in order to provide improved sensation and alignment. Initially designed for use by pediatric patients but now sometimes used by the adult population, a DAFO encourages range of motion, allowing children to learn movement by moving and providing minimal support, only where the patient needs it. DAFOs are frequently prescribed to assist with mobility and motor skills of children with cerebral palsy, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, clubfoot and autism. The concept for the original DAFO was developed in 1985 as collaboration between Don Buethorn, CPO, and Nancy M. Hylton, PT, LO. The two worked together to create a thin, flexible brace that would meet the needs of pediatric patients with neurodevelopment challenges and the result was the creation of a Washington state-based company, Cascade Dafo, Inc. Evolution:Initially dynamic Ankle Foot Orthoses were designed to stimulate or inhibate certain muscles in order to control lower leg spasticity by the application of pressure zones on the foot. The concept was further developed and DAFO's are now prescribed in order to re-align and maintain the foot so that gross motor function is improved, especially for CP patients. Indications :It is indicated for patients with flat valgus foot from 5 to 10 years old.Patients with mild deformity of the foot. Advantages: -Increases stride length, reduce excessive plantar flexion for CP children.-Increases child's stability by realignment of the foot -Improves the gross motor skills of children with cerebral palsy. Limitations: -Combination of stiff and flexible material has to be accurate. -Accurate marking of the pressure and relief points have to be realized by an experienced orthotist.-Standards of manufacturing varies within suppliers and researchers.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Orthopedic_braces,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Brace102887209 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Strengthener104336034 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Support104359589 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatOrthopedicBraces

Actual applications of Self-microemulsifying drug delivery system' (SMEDDS) remain rare. The first drug marketed as a SMEDDS was cyclosporin, and it had significantly improved bioavailability compared with the conventional solution. In the last decade, several SMEDDS loaded with antiviral drugs (ritonavir, saquinavir) were tested for treatment of HIV infection, but the relative improvement in clinical benefit was not significant. The SMEDDS formulation of ritonavir (soft capsules) has been withdrawn in some countries. Within the last years SMEDDS were also utilized for the oral administration of biologics. Due to ion pairing with appropriate surfactants these mainly hydrophilic macromolecular drugs can be incorporated in the lipophilic phase of SMEDDS. Provided that the oily droplets being formed in the gut are sufficiently stable towards lipases, can permeate the mucus gel layer in sufficient quantities and exhibit permeation enhancing properties the oral bioavailability of various biologics can be strongly improved SMEDDS offer numerous advantages: spontaneous formation, ease of manufacture, thermodynamic stability, and improved solubilization of bioactive materials. Improved solubility contributes to faster release rates and greater bioavailability. For many drugs taken by mouth, faster release rates improve the drug acceptance by consumers. Greater bioavailability means that less drug need be used; this may lower cost, and does lower the stomach irritation and toxicity of drugs taken by mouth. For oral use, SMEDDS may be formulated as liquids or solids, the solids packaged in capsules or tablets. Limited studies comparing these report that in terms of bioavailability liquid SMEDDS are superior to solid SMEDDS, which are superior to conventional tablets. Liquid SMEDDS have also shown value in injectable (IV and urethral) formulations and in a topical (oral) spray.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drug_delivery_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Device103183080 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDrugDeliveryDevices

In many animals, electrical synapse-based systems co-exist with chemical synapses. Compared to chemical synapses, electrical synapses conduct nerve impulses faster, but, unlike chemical synapses, they lack gain—the signal in the postsynaptic neuron is the same or smaller than that of the originating neuron. The fundamental bases for perceiving electrical synapses comes down to the connexons that are located in the gap junction between two neurons. Electrical synapses are often found in neural systems that require the fastest possible response, such as defensive reflexes. An important characteristic of electrical synapses is that they are mostly bidirectional (allow impulse transmission in either direction).",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Anatomy106057539 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Biology106037666 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Content105809192 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Discipline105996646 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/KnowledgeDomain105999266 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LifeScience106037298 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Morphology106078327 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/NaturalScience106000400 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Science105999797 | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/AnatomicalStructure | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4936952

The EU acted to adopt UDI and on April 5, 2017, under the EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and In-vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR), but adoption has been postponed to 2021; see Medical Device Regulation. These harmonized pieces of legislation include language related to the establishment of a Unique Device Identification System. When implemented, the new system will require: 
* The label of a device to bear a unique identifier, unless an alternative location is specified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or unless an exception is made for a particular device or group of devices. 
* The unique identifier to be able to identify the device through distribution and use 
* The unique identifier to include the lot or serial number if specified by FDA A national UDI system will create a common vocabulary for reporting and enhance electronic tracking abilities. Currently, analysis of adverse event reports is limited by the fact that the specific devices involved in an incident are often not known with the required degree of specificity. Without a common vocabulary for medical devices, meaningful analysis based on data from existing voluntary systems is problematic. Reliable and consistent identification of medical devices would enable safety surveillance so that the FDA and manufacturers could better identify potential problems or device defects, and improve patient care. The UDI is expected to improve patient safety (in part by helping to identify counterfeit products and by improving the ability of staff to distinguish between devices that are similar in appearance but serve different functions), facilitate and improve the recall process, and create efficiences within the medical system. In the most basic format, the UDI would be a coded number registered with standards organizations, and would incorporate a variety of information, including (but not limited to) the manufacturer of the device, expiry dates, the make and model of the device, and any special attributes that the device may possess. In a medical sense, ""device"" refers to any product that is not pharmaceutical in nature, and while the FDA have been given approval to exempt some devices, Jay Crowely (who was responsible for implementing the UDI requirements in the Act), has expressed an intent to apply the UDI to ""everything until somebody gives us good reason not to"", (excluding devices which won't need identification). Following the passing of the Act, there were calls for the FDA to publish a timeline for the implementation of the UDI; this was subsequently done. GUDID SubmissionThe Final Rule on Unique Device Identifiers also mandates medical device manufacturers to make a submission to the FDA's Global Unique Device Identification Database. The submission to the GUDID will include the Primary Device Identifier portion of the UDI as well as associated data attributes about each model or version number of the device. Compliance with the submission component of UDI compliance is phased according to the Class of device. Class III device labelers must submit to the GUDID for all existing products by September 24, 2014. Labelers of Implantable, Life Supporting or Life Sustaining devices must submit to the GUDID by September 24, 2015. Class II labelers must comply with submission guidelines by September 24, 2016, and Class I labelers by September 24, 2018. Submission to the GUDID may be made in one of two methods. The first method utilizes the FDA's GUDID Web Interface, which is meant for low volumes of GUDID submissions. The second method utilizes an HL7 SPL submission and is transmitted to the FDA through an Electronic Submission Gateway account. Once the initial submission is made, labelers of medical devices must update the GUDID submission each time there is a change to the device attributes. While many device attributes may be updated once the device record is published within the GUDID, several attributes cannot be changed and will necessitate the labeler deactivate the existing submission and resubmit using a new Device Identifier.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Regulation_of_medical_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Communication100033020 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Identifier107270601 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Signal106791372 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Symbol106806469 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatIdentifiers

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an analytical technique that can be used to complement the more common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the characterization of tissue. Both techniques typically acquire signal from hydrogen protons (other endogenous nuclei such as those of Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus are also used), but MRI acquires signal primarily from protons which reside within water and fat, which are approximately a thousand times more abundant than the molecules detected with MRS. As a result, MRI often uses the larger available signal to produce very clean 2D images, whereas MRS very frequently only acquires signal from a single localized region, referred to as a ""voxel"".

Other fields are induced by movement of a conducting organism through the earth's magnetic field, or from atmospheric electricity. Electrolocating fish use this ability to detect prey, locate other fish, avoid predators, and perhaps to navigate by the Earth's magnetic field. Electroreceptors probably evolved once or twice early in vertebrate evolution, but the sense was apparently lost in amniotes, and in a large number of the Actinopterygii (ray finned fishes) only to reappear independently in two teleost clades. In fish, the ampullary receptor is a specialized receptor that it uses to sense these electric fields and allows the fish to follow electric field lines to their source. Sharks primarily use specialized receptors, called Ampullae of Lorenzini, to detect their prey's low frequency DC fields and may also use their receptors in navigation by the Earth's magnetic field. Weakly electric fish use their ampullary receptors and tuberous receptors to detect the weakly electric fields produced by other fish, as well as for possible predator avoidance. Passive electrolocation contrasts with active electrolocation, in which the animal emits its own weak self generated electric field and detects nearby objects by detecting the distortion of its produced electric field. In active electrolocation the animal senses its own electromotor discharge or reafference instead of some externally generated electric field or discharge.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Election

His work Wall of History, a mural depicting centuries of African-American history, located at the entrance to downtown Fort Lauderdale's Sistrunk Boulevard, has been called his greatest achievement. Mills was born on December 14, 1920, in New York City and grew up in Harlem. He attended an arts high school in Manhattan. As a youth, Mills learned about his roots through his frequent visits to a collection of books on African-American culture and history located on the second floor of a building on 135th Street, a collection that was later placed in the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Mills served in the United States Army and after completing his military service worked as a medical illustrator at the VA Medical Center in Brooklyn. This was a position that his daughter described as having ""brought out the art in him"" and Mills would go on to spend two decades designing and illustrating medical books. He started designing fine art, after taking instruction at The Career School of Commercial Illustration in New York and at the Brooklyn Museum, with many of his works shown in collections and galleries in New York City. He moved to South Florida in 1985, settling in Fort Lauderdale. He taught at the Coral Springs Museum of Art, continued painting and had his works shown in area galleries and museums. His mural at the entrance to Sistrunk Boulevard in his adopted home town, commissioned by the City of Fort Lauderdale, have been considered his greatest work, telling the story of the African-American experience from slavery to modern times. In 2009, the Jim Moran Foundation honored him as an African-American Achiever for his six decades of painting and his focus on the African-American experience. Mills died at age 88 on October 20, 2009, at a hospice in Pembroke Pines, Florida. He was survived by his wife, Thelma, as well as by two daughters Renee Chester and Denise Collins, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_illustrators,literal,http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

Wheelchair lifts can be installed in homes or businesses and are often added to both private and public vehicles in order to meet accessibility requirements laid out by disability acts. These mobility devices are often installed in homes as an alternative to a stair lift, which only transport a passenger and not his/her wheelchair or mobility scooter. In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) required that all new mass transit vehicles placed into service after July 1, 1993, be accessible to persons in wheelchairs, and until the 2000s, this requirement was most commonly met by the inclusion of a wheelchair lift. In 1993, there were 29,033 transit buses in the U.S. equipped with wheelchair lifts or ramps, representing 52 percent of all U.S. transit buses. By 2001, this figure had grown to 58,785 buses (although the percentage that were equipped with lifts, as opposed to ramps, is unknown). Low-floor transit vehicles (buses, streetcars, light rail cars) – fitted with ramps or bridge plates rather than lifts – later began to become more common than lifts for heavy-duty transit vehicles, while lifts continue to be used in paratransit vehicles. A number of legal regimes in various countries regulate the use of wheelchair lifts, setting forth standards for the devices and requiring certain kinds of businesses to make parking lots accessible to vehicles bearing the devices. In some instances, accessibility standards have been achieved in legal settlements. For example, in the 2005 case of Dilworth, et al. v. City of Detroit, NO. 2:04- cv-73152 (E.D. Mich. 2005), the defendant city conceded that the Americans With Disabilities Act and its supporting legislation required the city ""to maintain the wheelchair lifts on its buses in operative condition; promptly repair wheelchair lifts if they are damaged or out of order; establish a system of regular and frequent maintenance checks of wheelchair lifts; remove a vehicle from service if the lift is inoperative (with limited exceptions); provide alternative transportation when the lift doesn't work and the next accessible bus is more than 30 minutes away."" While some wheelchair-accessible vans use a powered lift to assist the occupant in boarding, a wheelchair ramp is usually less expensive for this purpose and is often installed on minivans. Full-size vans require the use of a platform lift. There are two types of platform lifts installed on wheelchair-accessible vans: single-arm and dual-arm. Single-arm wheelchair lifts are only used in side-entry applications. They take up less interior space and leave the passenger entry open; however, they have less lifting capacity than dual-arm lifts. Most dual-arm wheelchair lifts have a lift capacity up to 800 pounds. These lifts consume more interior space and block the side entry and, for these reasons, are often mounted in the back of the vehicle for rear-entry applications. As mandated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), wheelchair-accessible vans with wheelchair lifts are equipped with a safety lift interlock. Designed to prevent operation of the wheelchair van or wheelchair lift in unsafe situations, the safety interlock will sound an alarm if an unsafe condition exists (e.g., the vehicle attempts to move while the lift is deployed) or prevent the vehicle from shifting into drive while the wheelchair lift is in operation. In 2002, innovations allowed the development of wheelchair lifts that assist people in entering truck cabs, so that they may drive or operate heavy equipment. Wheelchair lifts can also be used to move an unoccupied scooter into a vehicle.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Mobility_devices,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Artifact100021939 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Chair103001627 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Furnishing103405265 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Furniture103405725 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Instrumentality103575240 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Seat104161981 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Wheelchair104576002 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatWheelchairs

Spinal fMRI has been used to produce maps of neuronal activity at most levels of the spinal cord in response to various stimuli, such as touch, vibration, and thermal changes, and with motor tasks. Research applications of spinal fMRI to date include studies of normal sensory and motor function, and studies of the effects of trauma to the spinal cord (1-3) and multiple sclerosis (4). Two different data acquisition methods have been applied, one based on the established BOLD (blood-oxygen-level dependent) fMRI methods used in the brain, and the other based on SEEP (signal enhancement by extravascular water protons) contrast with essentially proton-density weighted spin-echo imaging (see MRI). The majority of the studies published to date are based on the SEEP contrast method. Methods demonstrated to overcome the challenges listed above include using a recording of the heart-beat to account for the related time course of spinal cord motion, acquiring image data with relatively high (~ 1-2 mm) spatial resolution to detect fine structural details, and acquiring images in thin contiguous sagittal slices to span a large extent of the spinal cord. Methods based on BOLD contrast have employed parallel imaging techniques to accelerate data acquisition, and imaging slices transverse to the spinal cord, in order to reduce the effects of spatial magnetic field distortions (5). Methods based on SEEP contrast have been developed specifically because they have low sensitivity to magnetic field distortions while maintaining sensitivity to changes in neuronal activity.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroimaging,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film

The radiation types of greatest concern are thermal radiation, radio frequency energy, ultraviolet light and ionizing radiation. The most common type of radiation burn is a sunburn caused by UV radiation. High exposure to X-rays during diagnostic medical imaging or radiotherapy can also result in radiation burns. As the ionizing radiation interacts with cells within the body—damaging them—the body responds to this damage, typically resulting in erythema—that is, redness around the damaged area. Radiation burns are often discussed in the same context as radiation-induced cancer due to the ability of ionizing radiation to interact with and damage DNA, occasionally inducing a cell to become cancerous. Cavity magnetrons can be improperly used to create surface and internal burning. Depending on the photon energy, gamma radiation can cause very deep gamma burns, with 60Co internal burns common. Beta burns tend to be shallow as beta particles are not able to penetrate deeply into the person; these burns can be similar to sunburn. Alpha particles can cause internal alpha burns if inhaled, with external damage (if any) being limited to minor erythema. Radiation burns can also occur with high power radio transmitters at any frequency where the body absorbs radio frequency energy and converts it to heat. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) considers 50 watts to be the lowest power above which radio stations must evaluate emission safety. Frequencies considered especially dangerous occur where the human body can become resonant, at 35 MHz, 70 MHz, 80-100 MHz, 400 MHz, and 1 GHz.

After the war he resumed research at The University of Cambridge, where he developed interference microscopy that would be suitable for studying muscle fibres. In 1952, he was joined by a German physiologist Rolf Niedergerke. Together they discovered in 1954 the mechanism of muscle contraction, popularly called the ""sliding filament theory"", which is the foundation of our modern understanding of muscle mechanics. In 1960 he became head of the Department of Physiology at University College London. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1955, and President in 1980. The Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal in 1973 for his collective contributions to the understanding of nerve impulses and muscle contraction.

The basis for modern dental implants is a biologic process called osseointegration, in which materials such as titanium form an intimate bond to bone. The implant fixture is first placed so that it is likely to osseointegrate, then a dental prosthetic is added. A variable amount of healing time is required for osseointegration before either the dental prosthetic (a tooth, bridge or denture) is attached to the implant or an abutment is placed which will hold a dental prosthetic/crown. Success or failure of implants depends on the health of the person receiving the treatment, drugs which affect the chances of osseointegration, and the health of the tissues in the mouth. The amount of stress that will be put on the implant and fixture during normal function is also evaluated. Planning the position and number of implants is key to the long-term health of the prosthetic since biomechanical forces created during chewing can be significant. The position of implants is determined by the position and angle of adjacent teeth, by lab simulations or by using computed tomography with CAD/CAM simulations and surgical guides called stents. The prerequisites for long-term success of osseointegrated dental implants are healthy bone and gingiva. Since both can atrophy after tooth extraction, pre-prosthetic procedures such as sinus lifts or gingival grafts are sometimes required to recreate ideal bone and gingiva. The final prosthetic can be either fixed, where a person cannot remove the denture or teeth from their mouth, or removable, where they can remove the prosthetic. In each case an abutment is attached to the implant fixture. Where the prosthetic is fixed, the crown, bridge or denture is fixed to the abutment either with lag screws or with dental cement. Where the prosthetic is removable, a corresponding adapter is placed in the prosthetic so that the two pieces can be secured together. The risks and complications related to implant therapy divide into those that occur during surgery (such as excessive bleeding or nerve injury), those that occur in the first six months (such as infection and failure to osseointegrate) and those that occur long-term (such as peri-implantitis and mechanical failures). In the presence of healthy tissues, a well-integrated implant with appropriate biomechanical loads can have 5-year plus survival rates from 93 to 98 percent and 10 to 15 year lifespans for the prosthetic teeth. Long-term studies show a 16- to 20-year success (implants surviving without complications or revisions) between 52% and 76%, with complications occurring up to 48% of the time.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Dental_equipment | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MedicalProcedure101024392 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Operation100671351 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Procedure101023820 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatDentalMaterials | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSurgicalProcedures | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/MilitaryUnit | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

The idea of a medical tricorder comes from an imaginary device on the science fiction TV show Star Trek from the 1960s which featured fictional character Dr. Leonard McCoy using it to instantly diagnose medical conditions. One description of the fictional device was as follows: The medical tricorder has a detachable, high-resolution, hand-held scanner that sends life-sign information to the tricorder itself. It can check all vital organ functions, detect the presence of dangerous organisms, and human physiology. Its data banks also contain information on non-human races known to the Federation, thereby making it possible to treat other life-forms. — report in the BBC Several reports suggest that there may be opposition to the development of such a device by national medical regulating authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, as well as possible opposition by doctors unwilling to permit consumers to do extensive self-diagnosis which might result in inappropriate self-medication.

Additionally, the open console means I can operate comfortably, helping to reduce physical tiredness from surgery. As far as the patient is concerned, obviously there is less pain, less bleeding and less risk of infection. I feel we need to elaborate on the advantages to the surgeon.

The most clinical experience has been with electrical stimulation. Neuromodulation, whether electrical or magnetic, employs the body's natural biological response by stimulating nerve cell activity that can influence populations of nerves by releasing transmitters, such as dopamine, or other chemical messengers such as the peptide Substance P, that can modulate the excitability and firing patterns of neural circuits. There may also be more direct electrophysiological effects on neural membranes as the mechanism of action of electrical interaction with neural elements. The end effect is a ""normalization"" of a neural network function from its perturbed state. Presumed mechanisms of action for neurostimulation include depolarizing blockade, stochastic normalization of neural firing, , reduction of neural firing keratosis, and suppression of neural network oscillations. Although the exact mechanisms of neurostimulation are not known, the empirical effectiveness has led to considerable application clinically. Existing and emerging neuromodulation treatments also include application in medication-resistant epilepsy, chronic head pain conditions, and functional therapy ranging from bladder and bowel or respiratory control to improvement of sensory deficits, such as hearing (cochlear implants and auditory brainstem implants) and vision (retinal implants). Technical improvements include a trend toward minimally invasive (or noninvasive) systems; as well as smaller, more sophisticated devices that may have automated feedback control, and conditional compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging. Neuromodulation therapy has been investigated for other chronic conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, depression, chronic pain, and as an adjunctive treatment in recovery from stroke.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Implants_(medicine),literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Attribute100024264 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Condition113920835 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Disorder114052403 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/NervousDisorder114084880 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalCondition114034177 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/State100024720 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatNeurologicalDisorders

There are two distinct measurements: the size of the nuchal translucency and the thickness of the nuchal fold. Nuchal translucency size is typically assessed at the end of the first trimester, between 11 weeks 3 days and 13 weeks 6 days of pregnancy. Nuchal fold thickness is measured towards the end of the second trimester. As nuchal translucency size increases, the chances of a chromosomal abnormality and mortality increase; 65% of the largest translucencies (>6.5mm) are due to chromosomal abnormality, while fatality is 19% at this size.

The term ""forceps"" is used almost exclusively in the fields of biology and medicine. Outside biology and medicine, people usually refer to forceps as tweezers, tongs, pliers, clips or clamps. Mechanically, forceps employ the principle of the lever to grasp and apply pressure. Depending on their function, basic surgical forceps can be categorized into the following groups: 1. 
* Non-disposable forceps. They should withstand various kinds of physical and chemical effects of body fluids, secretions, cleaning agents, and sterilization methods. 2. 
* Disposable forceps. They are usually made of lower-quality materials or plastics which are disposed after use. Surgical forceps are commonly made of high-grade carbon steel, which ensures they can withstand repeated sterilization in high-temperature autoclaves. Some are made of other high-quality stainless steel, chromium and vanadium alloys to ensure durability of edges and freedom from rust. Lower-quality steel is used in forceps made for other uses. Some disposable forceps are made of plastic. The invention of surgical forceps is attributed to Stephen Hales. There are two basic types of forceps: non-locking (often called ""thumb forceps"" or ""pick-ups"") and locking, though these two types come in dozens of specialized forms for various uses. Non-locking forceps also come in two basic forms: hinged at one end, away from the grasping end (colloquially such forceps are called tweezers) and hinged in the middle, rather like scissors. Locking forceps are almost always hinged in the middle, though some forms place the hinge very close to the grasping end. Locking forceps use various means to lock the grasping surfaces in a closed position to facilitate manipulation or to independently clamp, grasp or hold an object.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Medical_clamps,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

This technique relies on the fact that cerebral blood flow and neuronal activation are coupled. When an area of the brain is in use, blood flow to that region also increases. The primary form of fMRI uses the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrast, discovered by Seiji Ogawa in 1990. This is a type of specialized brain and body scan used to map neural activity in the brain or spinal cord of humans or other animals by imaging the change in blood flow (hemodynamic response) related to energy use by brain cells. Since the early 1990s, fMRI has come to dominate brain mapping research because it does not require people to undergo injections or surgery, to ingest substances, or to be exposed to ionizing radiation. This measure is frequently corrupted by noise from various sources; hence, statistical procedures are used to extract the underlying signal. The resulting brain activation can be graphically represented by color-coding the strength of activation across the brain or the specific region studied. The technique can localize activity to within millimeters but, using standard techniques, no better than within a window of a few seconds. Other methods of obtaining contrast are arterial spin labeling and diffusion MRI. The latter procedure is similar to BOLD fMRI but provides contrast based on the magnitude of diffusion of water molecules in the brain. In addition to detecting BOLD responses from activity due to tasks/stimuli, fMRI can measure resting state fMRI, or taskless fMRI, which shows the subjects' baseline BOLD variance. Since about 1998 studies have shown the existence and properties of the default mode network (DMN), aka 'Resting State Network' (RSN), a functionally connected neural network of apparent 'brain states'. fMRI is used in research, and to a lesser extent, in clinical work. It can complement other measures of brain physiology such as EEG and NIRS. Newer methods which improve both spatial and time resolution are being researched, and these largely use biomarkers other than the BOLD signal. Some companies have developed commercial products such as lie detectors based on fMRI techniques, but the research is not believed to be developed enough for widespread commercialization.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Magnetic_resonance_imaging | http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neuroimaging,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/AnatomicalStructure | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/MusicGenre | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing

It consists of a zirconium alloy metal substrate that transitions into a ceramic zirconium oxide outer surface. The ceramic surface is extremely abrasion resistant compared to traditional metal implant materials such as cobalt chromium. It also has a lower coefficient of friction against ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), the typical counterface material used in total joint replacements. These two factors likely contribute to the significantly lower UHMWPE wear rates observed in simulator testing. Reducing UHMWPE wear is thought to decrease the risk of implant failure due to osteolysis. All-ceramic materials can have a similar effect on reducing wear, but are brittle and difficult to manufacture. The metal substrate of Oxinium implants makes components easier to manufacture and gives them greater toughness (a combination of strength and ductility). In essence, this technology combines the abrasion resistance and low friction of a ceramic with the workability and toughness of a metal. This combination of properties led to Oxinium technology being the first ever implant-related technology to win the prestigious ASM International Engineering Materials Achievement Award (EMAA) in 2005.

BIA actually determines the electrical impedance, or opposition to the flow of an electric current through body tissues which can then be used to estimate total body water (TBW), which can be used to estimate fat-free body mass and, by difference with body weight, body fat.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Activity100407535 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Measurement100996969 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatImpedanceMeasurements | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity

A DACI tries to provide an answer for people with hearing problems for which no solution exists today. People with some problems at the level of the cochlea can be helped with a hearing aid. A hearing aid will absorb the incoming sound from a microphone, and offer enhanced through the natural way. For larger reinforcements, this may cause problems with feedback and distortion. A hearing aid also simply provides more loudness, no more resolution. Users will view this often as, ""all sounds louder, but I understand nothing more than before.""Once a hearing aid offers no solution anymore, one can switch to a cochlear implant. A Cochlear implant captures the sound and sends it electrically, through the cochlea, to the auditory nerve. In this way, completely deaf patients can perceive sounds again.However, As soon as there are problems not only at the level of the cochlea, but also in the middle ear (the so-called conductive losses), then there are more efficient ways to get sound to the partially functioning cochlea.The most obvious solution is a BAHA, which brings the sound to the cochlea via bone conduction.However, patients who have both problems with the cochlea, as with the middle ear (i.e. patients with mixed losses), none of the above solutions is ideal.To this end, the direct acoustic cochlear implant was developed.

Neurons are removed from a chosen animal, plated onto the dish and allowed to grow (often kept in incubation). The application of an extracellular electric field shows that the cells will grow processes in a direction that demonstrates the direction of the applied electric field. This could be either in the direction of the cathode or anode, depending on the type of substrate the cells are plated onto. The mechanism underlying this behavior is thought to involve the effect of the electric field on receptors and membrane proteins on the cell's surface. These charged proteins would experience an electrophoretic force pulling them toward the oppositely charged pole of the electric field. Most of these membrane proteins are negatively charged, but the growth, when observed appears to be directed to the negative pole (cathode). This is a strange behavior that can only be accounted for by electroosmotic effects. Positively charged ions outside the cell experience a force towards the cathode. There is a flux of these ions outside the cell and the shear force of solution movement is thought to pull the neurite in the cathodal direction. Also, the electric field may depolarize the cell near the cathodal side opening voltage-gated calcium channels and allowing calcium ions to enter the cell. Calcium is widely believed to be a factor in neurite outgrowth. This theory has been challenged in a recent paper by scientists at Purdue University. Recent studies also involve differentiating between the effect of current on growth direction and the effect of a simple electric field. Studies involving AC and DC fields are also being conducted. This is currently a highly researched topic, in which many neuroscience labs around the world are attempting to be the first to have a feasible method of directing outgrowth. Potential applications involve the direction and regeneration of severed nerves although these would only become available in the very distant future. This technique would also be useful in the study of neuronal networks. Neurites could be directed toward each other over large distances and allowed to form synapses. Networks of hundreds or thousands of cells could be constructed and studied.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrophysiology,literal,http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Disease

At a certain moment this process becomes regenerative (vicious cycle) and results in the rapid ascending phase of action potential. In parallel with the depolarisation and sodium channel activation, the inactivation process of the sodium channels is also driven by depolarisation. Since the inactivation is much slower than the activation process, during the regenerative phase of action potential, inactivation is unable to prevent the ""chain reaction""-like rapid increase in the membrane voltage. During neuronal accommodation, the slowly rising depolarisation drives the activation and inactivation, as well as the potassium gates simultaneously and never evokes action potential. Failure to evoke action potential by ramp depolarisation of any strength had been a great puzzle until Hodgkin and Huxley created their physical model of action potential. Later in their life they received a Nobel Prize for their influential discoveries. Neuronal accommodation can be explained in two ways. ""First, during the passage of a constant cathodal current through the membrane, the potassium conductance and the degree of inactivation will rise, both factors raising the threshold. Secondly, the steady state ionic current at all strengths of depolarization is outward, so that an applied cathodal current which rises sufficiently slowly will never evoke a regenerative response from the membrane, and excitation will not occur.""

The most commonly used compounds for contrast enhancement are gadolinium-based. Such MRI contrast agents shorten the relaxation times of nuclei within body tissues following oral or intravenous administration. In MRI scanners, sections of the body are exposed to a very strong magnetic field causing primarily the hydrogen nuclei (""spins"") of water in tissues to be polarized in the direction of the magnetic field. An intense radiofrequency pulse is applied that tips the magnetization generated by the hydrogen nuclei in the direction of the receiver coil where the spin polarization can be detected. Random molecular rotational oscillations matching the resonance frequency of the nuclear spins provide the ""relaxation"" mechanisms that bring the net magnetization back to its equilibrium position in alignment with the applied magnetic field. The magnitude of the spin polarization detected by the receiver is used to form the MR image but decays with a characteristic time constant known as the T1 relaxation time. Water protons in different tissues have different T1 values, which is one of the main sources of contrast in MR images.

Medically, it is used by injection, nasal spray, skin patch, or absorbed through the cheek (transmucosal) as a lozenge or tablet. Common side effects include nausea or vomiting, constipation, sedation, confusion, and injuries related to poor coordination. Serious side effects may include decreased respiratory rate (respiratory depression), serotonin syndrome, low blood pressure, or development of an opioid use disorder. Fentanyl works primarily by activating μ-opioid receptors. It is around 100 times stronger than morphine, about 50 times stronger than heroin. Some fentanyl analogues such as carfentanil are up to ~10,000 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl was first made by Paul Janssen in 1960 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1968. In 2015, 1,600 kilograms (3,500 lb) were used in healthcare globally. As of 2017, fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in medicine. Fentanyl patches for cancer pain are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2016, fentanyl and fentanyl analogues were the most common cause of overdose deaths in the United States at more than 20,000, about half of all opioid-related deaths. Most of these overdose deaths were due to illegally made fentanyl. In recent years, fentanyl has disrupted the North American drug market, capitalizing on pre-existing demand for opiates such as heroin and prescription pharmaceuticals. In 2017, it was the 250th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1.7 million prescriptions. At the same time, there is concern that the growing demand may prove highly attractive to organized crime and aspiring criminals, especially those operating in areas around the Golden Triangle in Southeast Asia and Shan State in Myanmar where production of synthetic drugs has expanded dramatically over the last decade.

FLT accumulates in proliferating cells where it indicates the activity of the enzyme thymidine kinase. Cell division can be characterized by the activity of that enzyme.

After crossing the specimen, photons are captured by a detector, such as a silver halide film, a phosphor plate, flat panel detector or CdTe detector. The examination can be performed in static 2D (named radiography), in real time 2D, (fluoroscopy) or in 3D after image reconstruction (computed tomography or CT). It is also possible to perform tomography nearly in real time (4-dimensionnal computed tomography or 4DCT). Particular techniques such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and several other ones complete the range of tools that can be used in industrial radiography.

The study is particularly helpful in differentiating conditions such as osteomyelitis from decubitus ulcers for assessment of route and duration of antibiotic therapy. In imaging of infections, the gallium scan has a sensitivity advantage over the indium white blood cell scan in imaging osteomyelitis (bone infection) of the spine, lung infections and inflammation, and in detecting chronic infections. In part, this is because gallium binds to neutrophil membranes, even after neutrophil death, whereas localization of neutrophils labeled with indium requires them to be in relatively good functional order. However, indium leukocyte imaging is better at localizing acute (i.e., new) infections, where live neutrophils are still rapidly and actively localizing to the infection, for imaging for osteomyelitis that does not involve the spine, and for locating abdominal and pelvic infections. Both the gallium scan and indium-111 white blood cell imaging may be used to image fever of unknown origin (elevated temperature without an explanation). However, the indium leukocyte scan will localize only to the approximately 25% of such cases which are caused by acute infections, while gallium is more broadly sensitive, localizing to other sources of fever, such as chronic infections and tumors.

This accounts for the dramatic improvement in both subjective and objective symptoms of hyperthyroidism, particularly when they are used as an adjunctive therapy with thioamides (propylthiouracil, carbimazole). They can be used in the treatment of patients with severe thyrotoxicosis (thyroid storm) and significant morbidity (e.g., myocardial infarction, or stroke) for rapid control of elevated plasma triiodothyronine concentrations. The use of iopanoic acid for treatment of thyrotoxicosis has been discontinued in the United States. In addition to inhibiting deiodinase enzymes, iopanoic acid is also a substrate of type 1 deiodinase. Iopanoic acid underwent monodeiodination in the presence of type 1 deiodinase in a microsomal mouse liver preparation.",literal,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radiocontrast_agents,literal,http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Acid114607521 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CarboxylicAcid114739360 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Chemical114806838 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Compound114818238 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Material114580897 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Matter100020827 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Part113809207 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Relation100031921 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Substance100019613 | http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatCarboxylicAcids | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ChemicalSubstance | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Drug | http://umbel.org/umbel/rc/DrugProduct | http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#ChemicalObject | http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing | http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8386
